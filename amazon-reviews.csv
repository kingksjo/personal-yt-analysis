It is a lot of fun the kids really enjoy this game they say it is a little different than the other games they play,1
Great game...it amuses me for quite a long time and enjoy trying to get through all the boards.  Have gotten other angry birds games.,1
I finally found out why everyone is playing Angry Birds.  It is a very fun and slightly addictive game.  I like the many different levels.,1
"Never thought I'd get addicted to this game. In fact, my 4 year is addicted to this game. It's fun and challenging at the same time.",1
I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that it is getting too difficult to pass.,1
All I know is that my kids love these birds the kindle version is great and mobile love this and suggest for all families.,1
1st I have to uninstall in order to get the new update. Now it crashes everytime I try to do any of the older levels. Rovio this is BS!!!!!!,0
I decided to get this app to learn why everyone kept talking about it. It's simple - it's fun and a bit of a mind bender. Just challenging enough to keep you occupied while you laugh at the set-ups. Good time.,1
"Amazing game! if you've never played Angry Birds before, start here!Its the new Pacman for sure!Great for kids, teens, and the elderly!",1
For those days you have to wait or try to keep your tongue this is the game.  I thought it was just for kids but no!!!  This is great and gets better and better the farther you go.  A must for folks that like to challenge their minds.,1
Several levels. So it is fun for all of us. I can get lost for hours playing this one. Makes one think about angles and things to win. Now I know why all the kids are love Angry Birds.,1
"Had been hearing for ages and ages about Angry Birds and thought to give it a try with the free app for Kindle.  IMMEDIATELY sucked in, my oldest 2 daughters (7 and 4) like to play it as a treat when school work, chores, etc. are done for the afternoon. ",1
"Okay, this is by far the best you can get from a free game. This has about ten or more stages with about 30 levels on each,so we are talking about 300 or 400 levels - no joke! This game also comes with like 20 mini episodes ( also totally free) that you ",1
"This game is too much fun not to have.  I haven't had any problems with the App at all.  A challenging game for sure, but it is fun and funny. I had to go online to find out what each bird does but that was not an issue.",1
Got this app for my new Kindle Fire HD.  Had the app previously on my android phone.  This is so much better. Graphics looks great.  Havent played much b/c my hubby is addicted. LOL,1
"The last level on the newest stage is so hard that it can very close to rage quit, bui still like the entire game.",1
"This is another game that I usually play on my phone and having it on my kindle fire is great.  It's a great game to fill waiting times in restaurants, airports, etc or during commercials at home.",1
This game is addicting.  You just want those bird to get all of the pigs.  I could play this for hours.,1
This game has no problems now you know theirs very very very very hoo  ads take me you will love it I this bored when I finished the game with all stars cause possibly angry birds is possible.,1
So many birds! So many levels! It's a really great deal! If I were you I would have bought it! It's really cool! And I'm not just saying that because the birds are cool! I hope you enjoy it.,1
"Definitely addictive.  Once you get past the first couple of levels, it gets more challenging.  sometimes frustrating!  I think if yu are an engineer or studied physics, you would do well at this game!  Fun--especially passing the time waiting in the doc",1
the younger kids like it alot,1
"It's so much fun, my husband and I  play it together.I don't care for the war games etc. but I love the simple little birds and piggies.",1
Who doesnt love angry birds.... The game is fun and challenging.  Provides many levels which get harder and harder... So much fun it becomes addicting,1

He loves anything that has to do with Angry Birds. Sure has helped me when I need to keep him occupied.,1

My wife got a Kindle and plays all the time more than reading her books. Shes better than I am,1
I had heard about this game and tried to see if I liked it. But what I found was the puzzles are too hard and I wasted a ridiculous amount of time attempting to solve them. I deleted the game from my tablet.,0

"Great game, loads of fun, even better on the Fire than on a smart phone, larger and easier to see while you take out evil pigs!",1
This game hooked me on Angry Birds. After this I had to go out and get even more angry birds.:),1
Despite becoming a pop culture Icon...this game goes down as one of the all time greets like Pac Man or Mario. Brothers. it holds up and continues to feel fresh no matter how many times you play. And who doesn't. try to get three stars on every level?,1
Kids love it. Entertainable will help pass some time in an enjoyable fashion. A great game that is free is always nice.,1

Angry birds is such a good game. Pretty common too. It is about some birds who got their eggs stolen by pigs so now they're out to get them. All of them. You shoot a certain number of angry birds from a slingshot and try to get all the pigs with the limi,1
I think Angry Birds Free is great!  I play it both on my Kindle and online on Facebook too.  It is lots of fun!,1
"I love it so much, and it is so great, my mother is addicted to it!  You should make angry birds mario, but it is AWESOME!!! 5/5! Well, really 240000/5!",1

"Got so engrossed in the game that I forgot it was demo!  Will have to purchase because I want to get further!Majesty was great on my PC, and this app fits the bill also!",1
Installs but when run will send you to the webpage to buy the pay version. Then it just crashes when you try to run it again.Amazon should remove this free version and perhaps even the pay version.This is not good.,0
this was a real fail! its almost impossible to win and its really difficult to use!!! I don't even understand why I got it. it was immediately uninstalled.,0
won't even let me open it. its up for like 3 seconds and then closes. I want out. I don't even know how to uninstall this. I'm not very happy at all.,0
I love it at first its a little hard until u know what u r doing but once u r hood and know what u r doing its great,1
"I could not play this it was too boring and confusing I'm going to delete it of my kindle right after this, I wouldn't recommend getting this app",0
If youlook at teh other reviews you will notice people like this game when it works.  It's free so you might as well give it a shot.,1
"Great game unless you are stupid enough to download an app that doesnt work on your device, hence all the 1 star reviews.",1
Majesty is a very fun and adicting game.  i tried the trial version first and then bought the full game.  Trial version allows you to play several locations to give a taste of the game.  Purchasing the game opens up more content. i hope the devs will be ,1
First off the controls for this app are stupid because you can't control the heroes that you hire. they just walk where ever they want to go and the graphics are terrible. got this for my kindle fire and it wasn't even worth downloading for 5 minutes. wo,0
I do not like this one I liked the one on my old Kindle better it was bore fun and challenging to play,0
Got it and was not pleased. Had to delete it. Thought it would be better but fell short. I am sure I will find one that measures up at another time. Sorry this wasn't it.,0

"This app is so good & easy to use I actually purchased the full version (& I don't purchase many Apps because I don't mind the advertisements). It is a must have App.  I use the clock, quick alarm & have many recurring alarms set.  You can silence your p",1
I set this alarm twice and it never went off...I'm not really sure why. Maybe I will try again at a later time but this didn't work at all for me on the Fire HD.,0
"i owned this app for probably three months. i've never had a problem i couldn't solve. the customizability is endless, i especially love being able to wake up to a different song in music library everyday. great stuff!",1
"I got this app as the free app of the day a while ago, I liked it so much I went over to the android market and paid for it!  I use this every morning and enjoy awakening to the nature sounds.",1
"This alarm clock is fantastic. I haven't got the full version but when I do I look forward to it. I have this app for my kindle fire and it works great. It has features that allow you to pick what song or melody to wake up to, do math problems before you",1
"Best alarm I have found.So many settings!  It is overwhelming at first, but once you get it dialed in, it is amazing.I have mine start 5 mins before I want to wake up, it begins with tiny trickles of water and slowly gets louder over the 5 mins (the scre",1
I love the app....if only you could buy regular mode for less. sometimes I need an alarm Wednesday but you can always have more than 1 app...the regular version is better,1
Repeatedly crashes on my Kindle Fire after asking if I want to install an add on. Maybe next version will be more compatible as this appears to be just what I want for sn alarm clock app.,0
Amazing alarm. There is something about it ringing gently minutes before the main loud alarm that makes you feel refreshed. I have not had a headache or felt groggy since I started using this alarm.,1
yes its Bejeweled but with enough of a twist to keep it interesting. runs perfectly on both my Samsung galexy prevail and my Acer iconia tab A500 with nice HD graphics on the tablet.,1
This one is fun and after each match 3 or more puzzle you get to buy pieces that help you in the puzzle. You don't spend any real money except for the cost of the game.,1
"If you like matching games, this one is well worth the money. Very polished graphics and gameplay, nothing like the tons of laggy, buggy free match games onthe market. Enough to keep my attention and want to keep playing.",1
I love this game! it plays just fine on my Acer a500 tablet. I played several levels and it ran smooth with no glitches. I will be playing this a lot. Thanks Amazon!,1
"Well done matching game that has great graphics on both my DroidX phone and Toshiba Thrive tablet.  I was given the choice to upload scores or not, as I wished.  The app can be moved to the sd card, too, which is something I like in an app.",1
"This is a jewel matching game.  Nice graphics and sound effects.  Satisfying game play. For those who have the Pandigital Novel, it works great on the 7"" screen. Also works great on my  Android phone.",1
"I hesitated to download this because of the review of a tablet. I took a chance and it runs great on my rooted flashback 7.1, honeycomb viewsonic gtab.  Runs great, good graphics, good game.",1
"This is a great &quot;bejewled&quot; type of game. The graphics are great and the combos keep things interesting. Unlike a lot of other match 3 games, the game feels like it is progressing and going somewhere, which I really liked. There are a bunch of l",1
Works fine on my Dell Streak 7 tablet. I've always liked matching games and this one has a lot more to offer than just matching tiles. Very colorful and works very smooth. I highly recommend it. You can also transfer it to your SD card.,1
"I got this game as the FAOTD. I can't say that I would have paid $1.99 for it, maybe $.99. The game is fun and addictive, but once it starts going fast and you get in the groove, the game is over. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of levels, but there ",1
"The graphics are great, and it runs really smooth on my HTC Incredible. Really fun and addictive! A must have game. Kudos to the dev.",1
This game is a lot of fun and designed perfectly for touch screen gameplay. It has great graphics and music and lots of levels to keep you entertained. I definitely recommend it.,1
"it's a great free game. very fun. even if it's a bejeweled clone, it's a good one with new gameplay features.",1
I really enjoy this game! I downloaded 2 and 3 because they are so much fun. Even my 8 yr old daughter has fun with these. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys the match 3 games..,1
"I love this game, and its sequel, Treasures of Montezuma 3. They are kind of the elite of match-three games. The difficulty level increases appropriately as you get more skilled, and the bonus effects that help you increase your point-earning abilities a",1
"This is a great bejeweled clone, I started playing it and soon realized I just wasted a hour and a half playing this. A good mix in difficulty with enough variety to keep you playing.",1
This game is really really fun and addictive. It has a ton of the stages. This not your basic match 3 game. Each stage has a goal and unlock new powerups the further you get. You have to get rid of a certain amount of special gems per stage and your on a,1
This is a bejeweled clone with lots of added features thats sure to keep you occupied. It's a well thought out match 3 game with puzzles to boot. An achievement badge system. Well worth the $2 after the FAOTD.Fast paced game on the Optimus V,1
Was able to play one game. Now application won't open on device. it is lost in cyberspace never never land.,0
"Great game to play when you're bored, waiting for the plane/train, in between TV shows, just before bed, or anytime, really!  The higher the level, the more difficult it is to get Montezuma to smile.  But you don't want to put it down until you do!!!",1
Have spent hours playing this one on HTC EVO. One of the most fun games I have downloaded. It appears to now work on Kindle Fire as well.Watch out for May 2013 update! Looks like all it does is push advertisements to the game menu screen (where previousl,1
I got totally addicted to this game and completed all levels.  Great way to pass the time.  Kids play it too.,1
"I don't play to many games on my cell but I love this game!! The biggest problem is that its too darn addictive, I can't put it down once I start!!!!",1
Honestly this is a genre that we don't need to continue producing. It's lame. Doesn't anyone have any originality? Barf.,0
"Yes,  this is another jewel game!  BUT it is by far the best!!  Runs great on my droid2.  Thanks amazon! and much thanks to the developer!",1
"I've had this game on my phone for a year now.  Amazingly I still find it the most entertaining Android game I've owned.  I buy them, play a couple of times, get bored, delete them.  This one is a keeper.  Perfect for waiting around in Dr.'s offices or a",1
"Out of all the &quot;match 3&quot; games, this one is my favorite. It DOES work kn the Kindle Fire, contrary to someone else's review. It always has, and that's how I've played since I bought mine in December.The game has a ton of levels, and lots of pow",1
I like the totems and bonuses. They make the game sort of unpredictable and ultimately more fun. I also like the puzzle mode. They took the gem game concept to another level with this app. Really great. Really fun.,1
"Works perfect on samsung galaxy.  Fun game, enough story to keep you interested, and nice clean graphics. 18 19 20",1
"Thought this would be another Bejeweled knockoff, but the added features are great. Was free app of the day months ago. Still enjoying it, and would buy it, if I ever needed to.",1
"I downloaded the free one at first, and I ended up downloading this one. It's always better to get the games you have to pay for, because the free ones, you end of having to pay in the long run anyway. I played one fast game on the free game, and I ended",1
"A fun game and long play time.  Worked well with Samsung Tab2.0, Pandigital Planet and would hang sometime with Pandigital Novel.",1
I really like how this game involves unlocking features such as bomb tiles and special abuilities like getting two tripplets in a row of the same color can grant you some special bonus power.  Power ups clustered in a match three game works.,1
"I picked it up as the deal of the day from Amazon, so I couldn't go wrong.  I don't know that I would have paid for it, but for a free game, it holds entertainment value.  It is very similar to all the other gem type games out there, but it is VERY addic",1
This is a wonderful game! Those who have compared it to Bejeweled are only correct in that you match the types to clear the board. But.... There is a LOT more to this game! You have to build buildings  with gold you earn by playing and earn tokens to hel,1
"I tried this game and I am glad I did. I was looking for Jewel Quest for my kindle, did not find the one I wanted, so I tried this game.It is another matching game, but the graphics are different. Tri it, I am pretty sure you will like it.",1

"Basically bejeweled Aztec style, that being said it's a fun game would def recommend. This is probably why it's been up for 2 days as AFAOTD.",1
I told her about this game being the FAOTD yesterday.  5 hours later she still hadn't set her phone down.  That allowed me to watch Breaking Bad and Storm Chasers. (both are shows she doesn't like)Auto 5 stars!,1
"Extremely fast paced and alot of fun. This game will probably replace my chuzzle addiction. If you cant get into it, delete it. dont give it a bad review. This game os pretty much excellent.",1
makes time fly fly away. couldn't believe the hours passed  by so far. would recommend to anyone who enjoys having fun.,1
I have been playing this game non stop for weeks. A very addictive variant of the classic match 3 game style. Works great on the Toshiba Thrive tablet.,1
"Awesome sound, color and over all feel.  Easy to play, great time killer, overall a great bejewled type of game. A few extra factors separate it from bejewled like earning points to buy some needed items. You won't be disappointed as long as you like col",1

"I find myself opening this app more often than just about any other game I have installed on my phone, and whenever I upgrade my phone, it's one of the first games to get reinstalled.There aren't any in app purchase requirements, a huge plus in my book! ",1
I'm hooked on this game! The ability to get upgrades to the various blocks and idols keeps me wanting to keep playing. I've actually chose this game over playing my Xbox 360 a couple times.,1
I loved this game on the computer when I played it a few years ago and its still a great game!,1
"I'm impressed by how well this works and runs on the Motorola Xoom (WiFi). It's addicting, and really attractive. A pleasure to play.Has become one of my favorite games in just a a day.",1
This is just like so many games where you match three items... but it is a fun updated version with power ups and levels. Not exactly my type of game but it can keep you entertained for a while. Works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.,1
I never played the first one but I love this one.  It is challenging yet easy to learn.  I like the graphics and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy.  A great time killer and just plain fun.,1
This game is fun and addictive. If you don't like this I don't think you could like ANY kind of app. Once again I LOVE THIS APP.:),1
"This is a fun puzzle game, although it's very difficult to get top marks on the levels. The trick is to wait until you have some new enhancements (totems), and then go back to the older levels.",1

"Hopefully solving video game puzzles is good for your brain, because this is another good entry.  I can spend hours playing.  Good graphics, sounds, and colors.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, give it a try.",1
I have several match 3 type games and this is by far my favorite!  a few new spins makes it more interesting!,1
This game is incredibly addictive. I play it every chance I get.  It is a very interesting and entertaining twist on Bejeweled and the graphics are fabulous.  Love it!,1
New variation to an old idea makes it enjoyable. Nice graphics. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play when you really don't want to be stressing the grey matter. I play it for a break from work.,1
"EVO 4gWorks  extremely well so far. Great fun, no glitches or hangs. Easy to learn. Loads fast. Looks professional.",1
"If you like bejeweled, you'll love this game. If not, you'll complain about amazon giving us too many free bejeweled games.Either way, it's free, so no complaints.",1
I know it is a good app when I can't stop playing it. it has more to it than just the jewel game.,1
"Finally some polish! This game is fun, beautiful, smooth, and substantial. Yes it's a  Bejeweled clone at heart, but that's not really a problem unless you didn't like Bejeweled. And this one has lots of fun extras. The professional design is so nice, as",1
This is the best game out there on Android right now as far as gem swapping is concerned. I play it all the time. It has some features that separate it from other games of its type such as power ups from landing 2 or 3 of the same type of matches in a ro,1
Got this when it was the free app but would definately be worth the $1.99.  I found this 3-in-a-row match game a lot better than others because you have a progress and can buy totems/upgrades plus you can compare your progressiom online vs other players.,1
"I have had this game on my Toshiba Thrive for well over a year and it is my favorite go to game. At least it was until it started requiring internet access to run. Now it won't open when I travel. This is a single player game, there is NO GOOD reason it ",0

"very addictive, reminiscent of bejewelled play style.  has a gradually increasing difficulty level with unlockable special powers. graphics and interface are nice on the fire",1
Love the look of this game and the music is ok too. Very addictive. Find that this is becoming one of my most played apps.,1
This is a game of hours of fun and many challenges that I have enjoyed conquering.  I think you will enjoy it just as much as I do.,1
"Great game. Just cant put it down. i have it on my Droid, Asus tablet and my Kindel Fire. Very addicting.",1
What seems like another boring old gemswap game is definitely something more. You have to swap the gems with inner gems to complete the round. You also have to collect coins to buy little trophies that will help you through the levels. I think the only r,1

I play this game every night before bed. It takes my mind off of my worries and relaxes me so I can sleep like a baby!  I love this game!,1
I am rating the game. Not Amazons choice for FAOTD or the fact that the developer chose to make a game of this type. There are channels for that. Amazon customer service and developer feedback. It is so immature and irresponsible to leave a low rating fo,1
I am enjoying this game. I do really like the jewel type games and this one has a nice theme and is different than others I've played before. I am glad I downloaded it. it works well on HTC evo.,1

"I just got this and when I tested it, perfect! I like the feature that it can show you the lyrics. Great app. Thanks for making this!",1
"It works great, finds the songs you need and is only second to Soundhound because you can't really hum songs into it.",1
i only tried 2 tags. one on tv and another from a music clip in YouTube. it worked both times. only if i could have had this app years ago when i was recording instrumental music on cassette tapes. i has a few sings i need to know who they are.,1
"I recently bought a new truck and one of the features I miss most about my old one is that the radio does not display the name of the song on the radio.  Not the end of the world, but now I don't sweat it anymore thanks to Shazam.Shazam listens to a bit ",1
For me I have had both sound hound and this app and for me this app was far better and faster at identifying songs especially in noisy conditions. sometimes identifying songs almost immediately after pushing the button. Blazing fast and highly recommende,1

"I don't know about the bad reviews. I've had this since day one and it has never let me down. I can't vouch for soundhound, don't feel I need to. Shazam never once missed a tag, from the 3 sec tv show or the car with the windows open.",1
Hasn't missed a song yet. Even picking up some indie rock. And it automatically keeps a record so you can go back later and see which songs you listened to that day to download.,1
This app has never ceased to amaze me when I'm trying to figure out a song and I have my phone handy. Great app!,1
Works every time. Always gets the song right. Then I can watch it on youtube or share it on Facebook or buy the mp3 from Amazon. Pretty sick.,1
"if you can't get it to install, DON'T LEAVE A BAD RATING. that's more your problem than the developers. mine installed flawlessly. -Nexus S 2.3.3",1
"I've been using Shazam since I first got an Android phone (April 2010) and it's always been my go to app when I need music identified.  For the most part it's incredibly accurate, but once you start trying to identify more obscure artists you'll start hi",1
What a great application! Works great on my EVO 4g and because I listen to music all the time this will come in extremely handy. Thanks amazon for the unlimited version for free.,1
The future is now. It never got anything on the radio wrong. Even remixes. An app that can make my doctorate in DJ-ing and my masters in music recognition seem like a waste of time? It's the apocalypse alright.,1
"I was originally going to give this app 5 stars, but now that I keep getting the Amazon Appstore: unknown error message and it keeps force closing.. I have to igve it 1 star.. please fix this..",0
"One of the biggest features that they advertise is the 3D Lyrics. However, after I purchased the &quot;encore&quot; or paid version that feature was greyed out. I missed the opportunity to get Shazam Encore for free last year, and that is what this is wo",0
I've been meaning to buy Shazam Encore for a while now. This version is ad-free and includes unlimited tagging. Don't forget that any app with ads can send certain information about you to advertisers.Shazam is a wonderfully useful app that you can whip ,1
"This it's a five star application, what I don't understand is how it's being given away free, momentarily anyways. It does what it should, quickly and easily with no complaints. A bit expensive normally though.",1
"Shazam is now more likely to provide quick and accurate results than SoundHound. This wasn't always the case. I've had this app since it was available free in March 2011. Initially, I preferred SoundHound because the earlier versions of Shazam performed ",1
"This app has found 98% of the songs that I&apos;ve searched for, including the ones playing in a crowded room. The youtube link also works well. Evo 4G.",1
This is one of the best apps out there to know what music is playing from tv shows to movies,1
This app is amazing! It works great and I love the ability to tag when there is no data connection. I use it almost everyday. Samsung Galaxy Tab.,1
"Have you ever heard a song on the radio, maybe even during a movie, and just couldn't remember the name of the song or who it was by? Well use this app to tell you! It's amazing just push the big button in the center of the app when it's loaded (It's a b",1

complete failure and soundhound is so much better get working on 3.0 asap you bunch of losers. Not even enough about this app to fill the word minimum.,0
Was amazed when I went to start of a random reggae song and it guessed it from just the start of a melody. Impressive! And you can do so much from watch YouTube video or listen on Pandora from the results!,0
Works great with my atrix( root). I haven't have any issues with the app. The app does an awesome job and is free. 25 word minimun really Amazon?,1
are no longer a problem with this app.  I love shazam.  works like a charm.  have yet to find a song it did not recognize.,1
im really happy that amazon made this app free for a day cuz I was really fed up with the free version. it works very well and I'm surprised it has only an average of 3 stars,1
I also have a spotify account so it's nice that there's integration there.  Or I just get them from the amazon store.,1
Great app for identifying music! UI is also very nice and simple to use.A definite &#34;must have&#34; for music lovers!,1
if you are like me and you love music but don't always know the name of the song or the artist this is the perfect app.  it will tell you all you need to know about the song and how to get it.  Love this and use it all the time.,1
"It worked on my OLD Lenovo Tablet but not my NEW one, with a newer version of Android. A lot of apps on Amazon are failing to keep up compatibility with newer devices. Fix this and I'll raise the the stars!",0
"Tried this because it was free and very disappointed. Much slower to ID a song then SongHound. Uninstalling, rather deal with ads in SoundHound. HTC EVO 4G.",0

If you have to go on Twitter get it. But it is still in the new stage. Very confusing! .,0

@namesping.  New to it but learning.  I would have never used it but entered a contest on The Ellen show with it and won so guess what. I use Twitter now.,1
This service is for people with egos so large that they feel the need to make every thought and action public and the people who love them.,0

This is easy to use. Easy to update with just a tug on the screen. I prefer to use it over the one in my browser.,1
Twitter is fabulous. How are people even allowed to rate this? Everyone knows that its a good app. I was happy I was able to get it on my kindle.,1
Interesting way to follow people you respect and know.Easy way to stay in touch with people's activities and thoughts.,1
doesn't everyone like to tweet and check what everyone else is tweeting? I don't like it as much as Face book but it's fun,1
Amazon is a company that still remembers what customer service is and also that the customer is always right.  I've done plenty of business with Amazon and it's always a positive experience. A few times I've run into a glitch and contacted customer servi,1

I love seeing twitter in such a great app! i love on my kindle fire how on the app the bird looks so clean!,1
It is everything it was advertised it to be. An app for Twitter. It hasn't froze once. And for me that is a big deal.,1
"I use it all the time, but you must choose your friends wisely, then again you must do that everywhere. If your friends are letting you know every time they brush their teeth, you've got the wrong damned friends! The inane and insane should be left alone",1

This app I love word well with kindle fire.  It is a good way to keep up. Is easy to use,1
"I use this more than the website because it's easier to scroll through the feed than on my computer.  The feed stays where I left it, and since I follow a lot of people, it's very helpful in keeping track of what I've seen.  This app is also fully functi",1
easy to access. Excellent App. Easy to use and access is rapid. Links are supported with no problem. One of the best apps to date.,1
If you use Twitter than you almost have to get it for any mobile device you own. It's nice to have a front row seat into the lives of people you may never get to meet.,1

The twitter app work great on all my devices.I can say honestly I would recommend this app to anyone that uses Twitter.,1

I don't really use Twitter but my nieces really like to use it so for that reason I will give it 1 star!,0
I have a few people I like and I follow them and enjoy reading what's going on in their world sometimes.,1
but generally a waste of time.  I find little of relevance to my daily life and I'm discerning in who/what I follow.  Bothered by intrusions from those in whom I have NO interest.,0
I like twitter and this app is easy to use and helpful. Easy to keep up with things in life,1
Have no complaints with this application so far. This is the social media I prefer to use so I am hoping the smooth operating continues.,1
Works wonderfully. It is way better than any other Twitter app I've seen to date. It's smooth and easy to use. Love it.,1

"Makes it even easier to get up and check my twitter. I haven't checked twitter in a little while since #TWD is done right now, but I know I can check it anytime I want now.",1

"I'm just not into Twitter, so I deleted it.  I already spend too much time with Facebook!  Maybe I'll use it later??",0
I could never sign in after I set up my account and posted my first tweet.  It kept sending me to the browser to sign in because it said that my account was suspended.  I tried to sign in in the browser but the security words that it wants you to type in,0
I read it everyday and have no problem with it at all.  But haven't read any for awhile due to lack of time but will resume it soon.  But it is really great to have it on Kindle Fire and easier than iPhone which is much smaller and sometimes hard to read,1
"This app is great. You get to share your news with people, without the intrusive privacy invasions that facebook has recently become. A+ app.",1
This is a well-built app - they anticipated how best to get news and tweets out on the fly. And it's easy to use!,1
I love twitter I have met many new bands and have met many new directioners a I get updates on yours and just about everything,1
Love to use this app. 140 characters or less to state your option. Good to talk about many issues from Breakfast to Immigration. Can even use it ti share pictures of your food.,1

"Twitter is awesome and it works especially great on the kindle fire. I'm on it all the time &amp; sometimes it freezes up but I think that's just my Kindle, not the app. I say get it!!!!!",1
this app does not work well for me. It can barley function and when ever I press on one thing-  it does the opposite.  honestly I do not think you should get this app.,0
"I'm using this to save all of my dates. I always have my Kindle with me, so it's readily available. I like that I can just write with my finger or an electronic stylus rather than typing with the little pop-up qwerty. Less typo's and auto-corrects that w",1
This app helps me when I cannot find a pen...I can just jot down it on here and transfer to my calendar when I get home!!,1
I love this app.  IT the easiest calendar to use. thank you.  ICan easily check it everyday and not miss anymore appointments.,1
Well I was optimistic but I really like it. You can write notes and make it your own. All you have to do is swipe to your right to go to the next month and swipe up to go to the next year over all I love it. they could add more Colors but it's a good app,1
"I have never been the kinda of guy that really ever needed an organizer.  But I started using this app and I like it.All you have to do is click on a day, then add your event.  You just write the event with your finger.  You can choose different colors f",1
"I was looking for a simple calendar, not this. I deleted it because I didn't like how complicated it seemed.",0
"Oh, dear, this is the second calendar app I have tried and I can't figure this one out either. Nothing seems to happen despite my attempts.",0
you wake up and have your day's plan at the tip of your fingers. You will find this app at as a very good planner.,1
I like this app but too much porn ads.I'm a child knowing about porn .it said porn on the ad.,1
This app is pretty much as basic as it gets. I downloaded it for my fire. You can add memos but not much else. I'll keep it until I find one with better functionality.,0
It's not easy to since with email. I would like to use it but since it will not since with my email I can't.,0
"i have been searching for a plain calendar app for free and not one was good. this one is perfect, and simple for my kindle fire.",1
Have several and like them all for various reasons and they are so handy to have right at your fingertips.,1
This app is awesome. It helps me soo much for my daily planning and memos. It helps me get really organized! I would recommend this app. You should get it. I hope my review helped. :),1
This was confusing to use and I simply deleted it rather than fight with it. Often it wouldn't load at all.,0
I like this calendar app.  It is easy to use with the keyboard or handwriting.  Great app to have handy.,1
"This program works excellent on my Kindle Fire, and ""syncs"" nicely with my Google Calendar.  Don't waste your time on the free ones!",1
too hard to use. it was fun to play with but I need to get the business done when shopping,0
After I figured how to use it with the icons and reminders it was great. Its the only calender I use now.,1
"I thought this app would be great, but heck no!!! its so cofuzing and you cant type anything, I wouldn't ever tell a friend about this!!!:( disappointing",0
"It was free.  What more can I say, there are others that are much better.  Needless to say I use another calender now.",0
Installed and uninstalled.  Needs a lot of work and fixs. Hope the developer will take the time to improve on a good base of a program.,0
This is a great app to become more organized. It was really a huge help during high school soccer season and will be more helpful during cheer season! YaY!!!,1
I like this app a lot and its free.  I like to jot down notes sometime to remind to do stuff. It works well with my stylus pen and Kindle Fire. I would recommend this app to others.,1
"I downloaded this calendar to my Kindle Fire. You use your finger to write memos to the calendar after touching the applicable date on the calendar. To go to the next month, slide your finger across the screen. However, I could not find a way to type a d",0
Hated it downloaded because its free deleted it just as fast dont waste your time there are better apps out there.,0
Ads aren't too bad. That quick finger note is not very accurate but works well. Nice quick finger note. Short learning curve - but you need to test.,1
never buy another ringtone again! this app uses the songs already on your phone to allow you to make a custom ringtone from any part of any song. i always hate how the ringtones you buy cut off at weird spots or they never have the best part of the song.,1
This music maker is very simple to work.  You just need music on smart phone or maybe any cell phone and it will make a ringtone a couple of simple move.,1
That was total junk. Never even ended up using it and I sure wouldn't recommend it. Nothing but a waste of time for me.,0
"You can click on any music in your music file on your SD carrd, and pull it into the ringtone maker program. Cut it where you want and then save it as your main ringtone or attach it as the ringtone for a friend. Perfect!",1
Lots of fun making my own ringtones from favorite songs that I have downloaded to my new Galaxy II S. Not hard figuring out the controls. I esp. like being able to clip any part of a song and choosing how many seconds it runs for. You can be very precise,1
I first tried mp3 cutter and ringtone maker!! and was unable to make a single ringtone because it continuously crashed. Then I tried Ringtone Maker and it worked perfectly. It is very easy to use and very fun making and assigning ringtones. LG Optimus G ,1
Best ringtone creator/assigner I've managed to find yet. Does almost everything I need it to. Assigning individual txt tones would be nice...,1
"Why would this app need permission to access protected storage areas of memory,  read and modify contacts,  check network connections.  Way too much access for a simple utility program,  no way I'm installing this app.",0
"I don't know if it was me or the app, but lets just say for posterity's sake, it's not you its me.",0
"I really like this app  Like many apps, it will not let you choose the directory or what you want to do with it.  If it is in the alert directory, then it must be an alert right?So, it works well and I have had a lot of fun with it.  Would love to be abl",1
"This the best ringtone maker/ editor  on Android.Easy functions for cutting /saving/ assigning your preffered tone.Did i mention it is free?.Works with Samsung Galaxy S2 and Ramos w12 tablet.Also tones can be shared by email,bluetooth ,gmail,facebook,etc",1
"I recorded and made personalized ringtones in SECONDS for all my individual idiot coworkers. A shotgun blast for one, Wilhelm Scream for another....LOVE THIS APP!!!",1
"For some reason, only about 1/4 of my songs on my SD card actually show up in the search. I also wasn't able to get it to make one I did find into a ringtone. It did the preview, but never saved it as a ringtone. I have an LG spectrum. It did work for so",0
"I love this easy to use app that helps you customize your ring tone.  I get frustrated when I really like a song, and there is a long musical intro at the beginning of the song. Traditionally on most phones you have to use the ring tone from the beginnin",1
"This app is absolutely fantastic. The app does exactly what I want it to do without any lagging or crashing. Honestly I thought this was going to be another piece of junk, but it works perfectly. I really didn't like the notifications my Kindle Fire came",1
"There's always a question of function when related to the Kindle Fire HD. I was pleased to find there are no issues here. This application delivers what it claims. There doesn't seem to be any bugs as I've ran it. It does sport ads, but they're tolerable",1
I have a lot of fun creating my ringtones from music on my phone with this app. I can make my ringtone as long or short as I want. I can pick just a chorus or verse from a song or a spot in a classical music sequence. Love this app,1
Really easy to use and understand.  Doesn't take a brainiac to make your own ringtones out of any downloaded music.  Quick too.,1
"Knowing that I have a phone that cannot register multiple touches that well (and most other ringtone maker apps rely on it), I love it to death. Does exactly what it says and does it well. Keep up the great work!",1
I got this so that I could use my music on my sd card for alarms and ringtones on new phone.  It didn't work for me.  No instructions and I couldn't get my rings off file. Glad it was free.,0
This app is easy and fun...make clips of music so that its the part of the song that you want by dragging the bars...simple and fun.,1
So so so easy to use to make your own ringtones or other notifications.  Once I got started I ended up making more ringtones than I needed just because it was so fun to use my own music and clip out the snippets I wanted.,1
"Start and stop your ringtone melody wherever you want, then save it. Magnifying the waveform helps pinpoint the exact place you want at the beginning and end. Other reviewers give more details, so I'll just add that I like this app and give it 5 stars.",1
Love this app w what ever song you have on your phone it will tack and you tell it where you want your ringer to start and stop in the song I have get this for 2 phones and would g stir agin,1
This is by far the best app I have downloaded yet. It says what it does and it performs great. It is easy to operate and best of all you can make any sound file your ringtone and edit any song to exactly the ringtone you want!,1
I love that I can take any song and choose any part of the song to cut for my ringtone. You simply play the song of your choice thru this app and take the bars on either side and slide them to what you want to be the beginning and end of your ring tone. ,1
dumb...pointless...and the girls arent even hot. just sticks and bones...at least it was free.( word limit word limit word limit word limit word limit),0
Love it this is a really fun app a good time killer!  The ladies are good looking! Blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah,1
Junk. Doesn't let you see the image but a second. Gameplay of ok though. Image updates would be nice too.,0
Trap balls in a box and reveal the pic beneath. I have played a lot of versions of this game going back to the late 80's and love them. Glad to see the classics don't die. The sexy pics are a plus.,1
"To the idiot that can't read and thought this was a golf game and then gave the app a 1 star because of your failure to read. Pay attention to app descriptions before you download, or don't leave feedback!!",1
Works perfectly on my DroidX.  Used it on my local course which was listed on the courses available (that surprised my a little).,1
I've had this app for over a year at this version. Their web site says they are at version 1.8 (or 2.0..... Hard to tell). I sent an inquiry asking how to upgrade and they told me to buy it from the play store since they can't update it on Amazon. How's ,0

"Don't bother even downloading unless you're a golfer. It does nothing useful off the course. That being said, I can't wait to try this nifty little app out next time I get time to play a few holes!",1
Actually bought this from Google market expecting it to be better than Free Caddie. Almost no courses in Michigan have I found. Stunning considering the number of golf courses per acre here. The web interface to map your own is horrible. It won't use you,0

Cnet been around for some time now and it owned by Discover CBS. You'll get all the up to date in the tech world from some of the best tech personality's in the industry of tech.,1
Figures competing from a sub par review cite we get a bad app. Poor design and most times ads make the app impossible to view. Deleting. The verge is much better  to go to anyway.,0
The CNET news app is a must have for those who wish to keep up with everything happening in the high tech world. I have to monitor my time spent with this app as it's easy to blow 20 minutes reading the articles.EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,1

I like the game. the physics are completely off but that makes it very challenging. you'll spend a lot of trying to find the right combination.,1

Very fun and challenging game. The new levels and unlimited playground modes are well worth the upgrade. Dev is responsive to suggestions as proof by the added  construction materials.,1

Still doesnt have the latest update. i was worried about amazon being able to keep up. its frustrating when the android market keeps reminding you of an update that you have to download here.,1
Makes more sense to buy tapatalk and have access to all your forums rather than getting this buggy piece of work and only being able to access their site.,0
If Amazon would update their apps as quickly as the market with Android does.Tired of the apps not being updated through Amazon,0
Good app. No problems to speak of and it can be fairly challenging. Music is peaceful and can be very relaxing.,1
Great little puzzle game.  I saw another review that didn't care for the music but I love the soundtrack.  It is running flawlessly on both my Droid X and Toshiba Thrive table.,1

Incredibly well done. Very brain straining and fascinating puzzle game. Many many levels and they just keep getting harder. New favorite.,1

hours of entertainment... totally worth $4... good graphics and good game play! can't wait to see what is next up.,1
this app does not work on the galaxy nexus. It freezes on the screen that has 2 panels. Please fix this.,0

"The overall concept of the game seems simple - start at one point, draw a line connecting all squares to a logical endpoint.  And it does have to be to a ""logical endpoint,"" which means a) the game doesn't have a big blinking arrow saying ""end line here!",1

"Unfortunately one star is lowest I can give. What a waste of an app.  No real value,  not the slightest bit entertaining except to those who are 2 years old. With Amazon's special offer to get this for free in feel I spent too much.",0
They say it's a good app for children but it's not I let my son play it right they hacked it and asked him like where's your school where's your home and he told them our adress so they might be coming right now so watch your children playing this app.,0
Had this app last year when we went to Montana on AmTrak.  Had a lot of fun with it when kids were around. Some haters on here just don't get it!  Chill!!,1
If talking to inadamint objects is your thing this app is for you. Slightly more entertaining than watching paint dry. How this app is so popular on market is beyond me.,0
My 5 year old love these apps. It does exactly what the review states. Obviously the people who gave this 1 star didn't read the review and don't have kids. You can also try out the free version to see whether or not you want to buy this app.,1
Spent a couple of hours with my Great Granddaughter playing with &#34;Talking Tom:&#34; love it!!!When I visit she looks forward to taling to &#34;TOM&#34;,1

"People should stop being so anal when rating this app. Its a kids app, that's why kids love it, so If you think the app is stupid there is the reason, rate the app on what the little kids think, my little sisters love this app",1
All it does is repeat what you say to it with a different voice. You can also punch and slap the cat around. So if you have anger issues or you are 2yrs old then this app might be for you.Not hating on just this app. Any app like this one is just as bad.,0
"This is the cutest little guy.  He mimics you and purrs, and a few other cute things.  What a pet, no veterinary bills and no grocery bills.  This little buddy is a great companion anytime.",1
Stupid. Don't waste you're time. This app is not worth a dime. Almost insulting that they charge for this garbage. Not even worth it for free.,0
makes me laugh.  had been wondering about this app for a while.  thanks Amazon .  does what's stated.  works well.  can get annoying but it isn't a game that makes someone want to break their phone in frustration.  good game to make kids laugh.  sat and ,1

"OMG!!!!! You have got to get this app!! It is totally awesome and fun for children!!  My 6 year old boy loves it!  You can record messages and play them (ie: Happy Birthday) and the cat in his cute cartoon voice, says it back!! AWESOME! :)",1
I don't understand why anyone would buy this app.  It's almost a waste of my phone's memory. Poke and speak to the cat which will repeat in an odd voice. Fun for 10 seconds.,0
"Anyone who thinks this is a pointless app obviously does not have a 4 year old. My son loves this and laughs hysterically at it. It gets old after awhile but is worth it while it lasts. Of all the talking-something apps, this one is the best. Large file ",1

"the fart works, but it does not repeat anything i say.  sucks real bad.  deleted 5 minutes after downloading the free paid version.not worth it for free, so do not buy.",0
I really don't understand the point of this app. For something that costs money it should have a lot more functionality. There's a definite lack of creativity.,0

My kids have loved Tom and many of his friends who have similar apps for months. I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people who are upset that the free app of the day is targeted towards little kids. It's not the app's fault that Amazon,1

"Had a lot of fun playing games with this app. It helped me with my games. Great, great, great app.",1
"As always Adobe works great, easy to use. Havent had any problems at all. Thanks .. What else can I say ?",1
I love this app it makes possible for two of my other apps to word flawlessly. Trouble without it. thanks.,1
ok i like adobe and i whont to get this for my kindle fire hd so amazon needs to get to it so i can get it,0
"Great app! Needed it to run my Flames Live wallpaper. It worked for that. Not sure what else it is helping, but it got the Flames going!",1
"If I understood this, I would probably give it a four.  With some purchases, you need to be very cautious.",0
"performs beautifully on both my HTC Thunderbolt and Motorola Xoom. Adobe is consistently updating the framework to add features. It&apos;s one of the options that makes Android openness superior to Apple&apos;s closed, pay for everything system.",1
I utilze this icon on a constant basis. I would definitely be lost without it. It has proving to be very beneficial and useful at the same time. It have me to be able to processed and use things effectively.,1
Adobe AIR is a pain in the butt. A necessary evil sometimes. But not what I would like to have installed.,0
I have no use for it even though it says I do. What exactly does it do on Coby Tablet? I haven't been able to find out why it doesn't work. I will delete it very soon. Please find out how it helps the mobile equipment work.,0
"All you iSheep flash haters out there quit complaining about it burning battery life.  Update your 1.0 install to the latest version that uses hardware acceleration, and battery life issues go away. Or you can sit around and complain about it (for anothe",1
I would recommend Adobe products as I find them to be most useful and do the things I need to do.,1
"works very well, gives access to all sorts of stuff. I've used this on all my phones/tablets since it became available. there are many reasons not to buy inferior LG or other low end hardware, this is one of them.",1
Another bloated and insecure piece of software from Adobe. It's huge. The performance was lackluster. Fortunately I can remove this Post completely. I wish the same was true of Flash.,0
need this to play certain games and other systems. It works pretty good and takes no time to download for use.,1
would not down load so I did not like it at all it sucks a lot and i am out of words,0
"This uses Flash, which performs terribly, is insecure and chews through the batteries. It&apos;s only used by lazy developers anyway so send them a message by using native apps.",0
"all Adobe products have been great for me. as usual its works great. I have been an Adobe user sense its launch, best way to download and transfer large files.",1
"Don't bother if you're using Virgin Mobile's LG Optimus V, it will not install. Adobe seems lost, the app is a hefty 16mb but does not work on all Android smartphones. Brute force programming, obviously.",0
I couldn't use it on my android for some reason.... For some reason my android was so stubborn on what I could use on that stupid thing....,0
"I would not have bothered downloading this application, but it was required for an application I purchased with real money. I wouldn't be so bothered if I could recieve a refund or if their existed a work around that wouldn't void my warranty, but as it ",0
definately worth getting if you are into flash. you guys with cheap optimus v phones need to stop complaining that your phones cant do anything. rate the app... not your cheap throw away phones,1
Good for my Kindle Fire to view PDFs on them and hey its Adobe how could you go wrong!  Didn't take up much space and a clean install.,1
"I don't use this app at all, but my grandson loves it and plays with it quite often. Was thinking about deleting but he plays with it too often.",1
"I downloaded this talking cat because it was a free app. Although silly, most people can't get enough of him. My 5 year old Granddaughter had fun with it for about a half hour, and people I work with get a great laugh when touching his tail for feet. Thi",1
When I downloaded this app all you could do is pet the cat and hit the cat it didn't do any of the other things it was meant to do.,0
Once again my grandson LOVES this one!  He could not wait to show this one to his daddy! when my grandson laughs it is magical with this it is often!,1
"This is actually a hit with my kids. I bought tablets for my 10 year old son, 7 year old son, and 2 year old daughter for Christmas, and this is one of the things I pre-loaded prior to opening Christmas morning. It was adorable watching them play with it",1
I cast my vote for one of the most useless Apps for 2011!  The quickest app that I have uninstalled from my device for being a waste of time downloading and space on my device.  Did I mention this is a useless app?  1 star as there is nothing lower to gi,0
My boy friend downloaded this for the kids and all the kids do is slap the cat until his falls. qnd the noise gets so annoying geez!,0
"I downloaded this app so I could play with it with my young niece and nephew. Once I opened it, I quickly realized that in order to use the app, add-ons had to be purchase. Not cool.",0
This game is so cute and fun I love singing into it and playing. I also have found my cats love it when I meow into it and then he mocks it back. They will come running to where I am. Great idea! 5 stars. No flaws really for what it is.,1
I think this is so cute and perfect for stress relieve! It is adorable. Everyone loves playing with this and the voice is super sweet!,1
Ok I was putting my kindle next to the speaker of my Tv then Tom started to repeat what the characters in CHOWDER are saying,1
"But he can be a pain, I don't know who's schedule he is on but it is not mine. Really cute and fun to play with. Getting the points was kind of hard till I got someone to show me to press on everything and I do mean everything.",1
"this one kept my grandchildren ages 4, 2 and 1 entertained for about an hour and us all laughing when he talked back at us.",1
"I love knocking the cat down and making it say funny things, and recording them for later. I think you would like it too.",1
Fun & silly.  Good when you need a laugh.  Very cute and a good way to make someone laugh when they need a good laugh.,1
"This is the old version of Talking Tom! You need to put on all of the other talking friends apps on the Amazon App Store. For example Talking Tom 2, or Talking Been, or Tom & Been News. Thoes are my favorite apps on my mom's iPad, but I want them on my K",0
"This is a fun app for kids, if you want to hear them laugh from the bottom if their hummus, this is the app!",1

My 5 and 3 year old kid loves this app. They love hearing Tom repeats everything they say and copy their laughs as they play with this app. It is a good time killer for the kids.,1

my nephew downloaded this game He played around with it for a while but I felt the image a bit too weird to tolerate it.  a cyber pet.. Hell no.,0
I got this for my 3& 1/2 yr old granddaughter and she absolutely LOVES it!!! She loves these types of things on the Kindle.,1
oh yeah--lot of fun creating your own messages to people and having to act out and record in his voice what you say. then email to friends for them to enjoy.  a must have for tablet or mobile. hilarious what you can get this cat to do and say.,1
Got this for my grand son and what surprise when it began to talk .  He had no idea that it would do that .  Laughed and Laughed,1
"I just love this app...... puts a smile on your face because it is so crazy, my grandson just LOVES IT!!!!!",1
Stupid game. Waste of time. Wish would never down loaded it. absolutely the worst I ever down loaded What were you thinking?,0
I can trust time more then I can trust any of my other friends. He does not ask to borrow money and not pay it back. He does not borrow things and not bring it back. Last but not least he won't talk shut about you behind your back,1
My youngest daughter absolutely loves this!!!  Keeps her occupied for a really long time.  It's funny listening to this and the kids will certainly be entertained.,1
"My great granddaughter learned to call her grandmother Me Maw , I kept repeating it to Tom and she would smile and say it after he did .",1
"A lot of laughs.  I love his little face, so expressive.  Kids love this app and it is free, a big plus!",1

"It seems that anytime I order an app online with Amazon, I never receive them in the cloud as promised.  Talking Tom Cat is one of those apps.  When I search for the app on my kindle, it is not available.  Fortunately, it's free.",0
Talking tom is one of the highlight of my day and I love when whenever I say something he says it in a much higher pitch,1

I got this app for my son who as soon has it on his iPod.  Their actions are funny and cute!,1
"This will NOT work on a Kindle Fire!  The Kindle Fire doesn't have a Microphone, therefore you can't talk to Tom, which means he can't repeat anything you say!  It would have been nice if Amazon had mentioned that this game is only for Cellphones (with M",0
"This is definitely for pre-school age kids. It is so silly that I am sure the little folks will giggle. For anyone age seven and above, I think they will find it pure silliness. However it was free and easy to delete.",0
"This app is great for keeping your grandchildren entertained for short periods of time, especially when they are 2 years old.",1
Do not get this app. It is really bad for children! I showed this to my daughter thinking she would like this but later that night she told me that she was having nightmares about it! I would give it zero stars if I could because this ruined my poor daug,0

I like to play with this app and my kids do to.Great fun for the price and hey I haven't deleted it so it must be good enough.,1
"i thought this would be fun, but i could not get him to do what the description said he would do, and it was just dumb.",0
"My children love this app, the kids interact with the cat. You can feed the cat milk, it purrs when petted, you can hit it on the head, and it falls over. The cat listens and mimics what you say, my children think it is hilarious.",1
"This is something we had to get. Saw it on my sister's ipad a few years ago, and luckily it works the same way on my son's new Kindle.",1
This game is a waste! I thought that it would be fun cause my friend has this app and it was so fun! But this game is not for any kindle! First of all....it does t even repeat what I say! And when I try to do an action I apparently have to pay for more f,0
There is a new hacker and Tom says where do up live and he records your every move. Stay safe and don't get this app and if you have kids who play it DELETE IT NOW!!!,0
.... weird. It wants me to buy Stuff. Don't get this app unless you want to buy things for 99 cents like food.  The only things you can do is Give Tom milk and a few more boreing things.  Sweat talking puppy funny dog is way better.  I give this app 1 st,0

My grandkids just love slapping this poor cat and instead of crying for my phone and running the battery down I let them have the kindle until they get tired or the cat just doesn't get back up.  LOL,1
My kids convinced me to let them download this app and we were very disappointed. It doesn't offer anything unless you choose to pay for additional options. I will be removing this app.,0
"What a cute sad little face.  However, it is fun to play with little kitty during a break at work. If you give it a name the fun is even greater.",1
even the free version is really cute and the kids enjoy it. i purchased the full version since my kids enjoy the free version so much. fun and worth it,1
"If you're having a bad day, just fire up Tom and he'll have you laughing again. I love his sqeaky voice and being able to record the videos and upload them to fb or send them via email. If you try to talk too fast it doesn't grab all of the words. My dau",1
Laughter is the best medicine and it makes me laugh when he repeats my words.  Sometimes he might miss some though.,1
you need to download so many different things to play this game its not that great really you r wasting your time with this one,0
who could ask for more?  This is a silly app and I don't really understand it but everyone in my house thinks it's so funny.  I see everyone (including the adults) playing with it.,1
This might entertain a three year old for a few minutes but even that's pushing it. The 'free' version is crippled beyond belief.  You're expected to pay for almost every feature. Don't waste your time.,0
I love when u talk to him and he's like a translator so please please please buy talking Tom the cat,1
this is kinda funny to play with. what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things),1
"My granddaughter loves this cat. We play together, wish there was more free stuff that you don't have to buy in order to get things for Tom cat.... :(",1
"DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL, IT ONLY DOES A FEW THINGS IF YOU WANT MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT",0
There aren't enough nice things that you can do with this cat. You can make it purr a little but mostly its geared toward punching and hurting the cat. The interaction is too violent and promotes laughing at hurting an animal. Disgusting.,0
"I got this app thinking that it would be fun,but Tom wouldn't repeat anything! Pointless putting it on the Amazon store if it doesn't work for kindle!",0
"This was a horrible app for the kindle Fire!it froze up my kindle Fire  and he would not even talk!if u r looking for this app for the kindle Fire,don't buy it!",0
My great niece loves Tom....not as much as Ben...I don't know why....kids. they like what they like and that's all it is.,1
"Fun for the whole family.It's a fun App, love the copy cat voice, the kids love playing with it",1
I love this game it is so fun I luv making it fall down its so funny Andy some people think that it's a wast of time but it's not it is awesome for kids my whole family Luca it (Thanks Tom),1
"Just a way to sell you add-ons. I suppose it could be considered cute, (Ben the dog is better)But it is a thinly disguised vending machine for in-app purchases.",0
This is so much fun the whole family can enjoy. The kids get the most out of it when he repeats what they say.,1
I love my talking Tom cat. My son has it & i found it very funny. Lots of laughs & lots of fun!,1
I love this cat! He has the cutest voice! I use this app to wake my son up in the morning. Just talk into your kindle and tom repeats whatever u say but in a way cuter voice.,1
This application was very laggy and very slow. The cat would move it's mouth with a delay of a few seconds for any words.,0
I play this with my grandkids and I don.t know who enjoys it more! It just makes you laugh. There is no thinking required.,1
This is such a cute app.  I could hardly get my phone out of my grandson's hands because he had so much fun with it.  It's fun for adults too.,1
This  app  is  the  worst  I've  ever  downloaded  it  stinks. It  is  so  boring  all  you  can  do is  tap  things.,0
Doesn't work that great on my Kindle fire. What a bummer as my young kids get a laugh out of it.,0
"When u need to break tension or make the kids laugh this is great, really like it when children smile and laugh",1
Tom cat is very funny & entertaining. You will keep the attention of any crowd. This can be used for all ages.,1
Talking Tom is better than the other apps. He's been a brilliant idea of a game. This free download has  hilarious cat.,1
Not worth the time loading....can't do anything but make the cat purr and knock him out. I would recommend you pay for this one so he will do more than two things. I was disappointed.,0
I have seen other people have this and it's as funny as can be.. but it didn't work on my KindleFire HD.. nothing! at least it was free.,0
It's great what I really like is how you can make videos and upload it to anything I uploaded my first one,1
I love the app but I am not sure if I like the original one or the 2nd one! So please comment me on witch one you think is better!,1
TALKING TOM WILL NOT DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE DEVICE. MY DAUGHTER HAS IT ON HER I PHONE AND I THOUGHT IT TO BE VERY FUNNY.,0
it works on my kindle fire but it DOES NOT FREAKING TALK TO ME!talking ginger is better. U HAVE TO BUY STUFF TO HAVE MORE FUNthis app sucks so much!!!!!!!!!!do not download!!!!!,0
doesn't do that much...amusing for the first minute or so.  I will probably delete this app in another week or so.,0
"My kid still plays with this app from time to time. She loves the noises reactions, and the way Tom Cat repeats everything she says. Great app for kids.",1
"So funny, we love it all of us do.  This little cat is so funny! We tell everyone about this funny tom cat all of us play with this cat all the time!",1
GAME NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY ON MY D2 PAD.  HAD TO DELETE IT... ... ... .... ... .... ... ... ...,0
My grand children love this app and play it a lot. I am very happy with it would recommend it.,1
When I talk to Tom he just sits there doing nothing not good for the kindle fire THIS APP SUCKS,0
Just a fun app to play around with and pass time - it is just fun and funny-I like it,1
Fun and cute for my daughter! Good for young ages! I believe K thru 2nd graders would love this Tom Cat!,1
Always fun to go back to this guy once in awhile.  Him and his friend apps are always there for a silly laugh with friends from time to time.,1
My two year old loves this! It doesn't get old for her and we share lots of laughs over it. It does just what is described. She loves knocking the cat down. It is helping her learn to talk as well!,1
"It's fun, grandkids love it.  He s cute, like all the different things he does.  Entertaining and they get a good laugh out of him.",1
This app is for my granddaughter and she loves to play with and really make her laugh when she is playing with it.,1
it's very fun and good. super fun to record and play with when bored. this is super great love it!!,1
It is so much fun to see this cat talking and complaining when you touch it is great.  It gives the impression that is real.,1
"I have an iPhone and loaded the talking Dodo bird on it because my 3 year old lives it. I got tired of him constantly getting my phone, so I bought him an Android Tablet for Christmas so he had his own device and could play with it anytime he wanted. Yes",0
"This download was the worst one yet. What on Earth is the fun in tapping a screen to punch a cat? Sure, I hate cats, too, but someone spent time on this? Try turning the hatred towards pesky felines into something more productive. &quot;Cat Drop Soup&quo",0
Amazon should mention that this app will not talk on the Kindle Fire.  I looked like an idiot talking to my Kindle expecting a response.  I will be deleting this app.,0
Most annoying app ever.  I can't believe I actually even downloaded this.  As soon as I opened it and used it once I deleted it.,0
It is hilarious!  My grandkids and nieces love it! Very entertaining!I would recommend this app to anyone with small or not so small kids!,1
"Said I'd have to reload, but we were able to get Tom 2 instead. I'm not sure if the reason it didn't load is my fault or not.",0
Enjoy myself and great for grandchildren who thoroughly enjoy it!,1
"When we're talking about this game, anything is better! I downloaded it for my daughter. I failed to see any warning sign that this would be a depressive game that requires you to torture the animal to get responses. I found it cruel and hateful. I wasn'",0
This app works great!  I use it to entertain my three yr old.  He loves it!  He has even figured out how to make videos with it.,1
I didn't feel it was appropriate for my children. Some of the things were ok but others werent. I have deleted it.,0
this app is cute and funny. all my friend's laugh and thought it was cute. it's a good conversation app to get.,1
How cute this is.  This cat talks to you and he is funny.  He purrs and does all kind of funny things.  Nice when you need a cute laugh.  Easy to operate and has a kids mode and adult mode.,1

fun for the whole family. The cat repeats everything you say and the hubby & kids have a blast with this app,1
I think it's great so much fun. My mom has it on her phone too. I have so much fun on it. It is fun for everyone.,1
Bests kids app ever a little annoying but F-U-N fun you need to buy this app I love it tom ( the cat ) is so funny he says what you say you can step on his toe punch him pull his tail and much much more he makes me LOL best:),1

this app is too funny. having lots of fun with it and other people. everyone needs to laugh. buy this app for some laughs.,1
This game is entertaining! My cousin (2 yrs old) loves to play it and is obsessed with the kitty :3 good for kids and up.,1
This is my favorite app to use for navigating and editing files on my Android phone. I highly recommend this app to anyone who appreciates good utilities made with integrity. I have not found 1 bug while heavily using this app for many years.,1
"This is certainly the gold standard for an effective app.  The UI is not beautiful, but it is not clunky and cluttered either.If the dev was aiming for an uber-functional and flawless app that simply does what it should and does it perfectly, he hit his ",1
This handy app really gets to the Root of the issue especially if you have bloated apps that take up valuable resource and space. Bear in mind you do need to be Root to benefit from this app!,1
"Excellent file manager app! Even the free version is great, and all you need if not rooted!",1
"Must have, only way to truly customize your phone and use all of the accessible storage space on the internal memory.Best money I hand spent on a app",1
very good so much,1
Awesome app. I use it a lot. Root is very useful and this app can be used for so many things. Even if u aren't rooted yet this is a good file manager to use. In most cases you can browse the root of your phone and even copy from but not delete the files ,1
"This is the very best root file manager with a very clean ui and tons of essential features, i would recommend this app to anyone. I also recommend getting this devs app &quot;SQLite&quot;, its another must have app:)",1

Very versatile and fast - the best for Android I've seen so far. A strong recommendation for gettings this app if your device is rooted and you need a solid file manager.,1
"This is the best application for navigating, modifying, and organizing your rooted Android device. Solid performance with a familiar interface.",1
If you want access to the file system on your android device this is it.  I am using it on my kindle and it is awesome.,1
"I have this tool on both my Nook Color &amp; Galaxy Tab.  You need this for all those little tweets to keep your rooted device running smooth.  I found that there is a small learning curve, but once learned you can&apos;t live without it.",1
I needed this to install the supposedly pre-installed Google Store/Google Play that my tablet shipped with.  Works well and has yet to disappoint.,1
"Having this app already, I must say that this app should come with every Android phone. Easy to use interface and straight to the point. 5/5 stars!",1
Anyone with a rooted phone will find this is the most awesome file manager out there. You can even see and edit the contents of a database file. Keep up the good work!,1
I use this on my Kindle to get around Amazon's stupid restrictions. It works really great and has allowed me to access the Google Play Store and actually get some good apps (unlike Amazon's... yikes).,1
Most useful app I've purchased so far. If you want to get the most out of your Android phone then this is a must have after you obtain root for your phone. Simple and intuitive to use. Thanks to the dev for putting this up on Amazon. Saves us Google Apps,1

I'm so tired of just sitting there.All thee is is just stupid stuff and your just going back and fourth.BORING,0
"Addictive and fun games. As with most games, attention span for me is one week. And then I play once in a while. This game needs no manual, no reference cheat sheets. so I like the fact that this is simple and clean. My daughter enjoys it too.",1
this game doesn't have any fun to it. I mean I got bored in just a second. They also need to make the levels shorter. I would not recomemd this game to anyone who likes REAL fun.,0
"The controls didn't work right on my galaxy tab, it acted like it was always tilted one way and wouldn't go the other way. Frustrating to say the least. otherwise it seems ok.",0
I mean mantel it shut down my kindle and I had to wait for the battery to run down but most of the time it also,1
I am giving this game five stars because everyone that has written a review can not spell for crap. Which means this game might be above their intelligence.,1
Worst game I have ever played. Wast of time the ball falls super slow and the levels are freakishly long.,0
ewwwww this game is awful. It put me to sleep. donor buy this lame exuse they call a game read the comments this game ducks.,0
Sometimes it is nice to have an app where no thinking is required and anyone from the very young to the very old can play,1
I loved it on my old ipod but unfortunately. it broke but then I got my kindle and Mt favorite game ever!!!!!!,1
this game sucks so bad all you do is tilt it sometimes the tilt does not even work this game isn't worth your time,0
I at first thought when I first saw the pictures of this game it was going to be one of those cheesy old time arcade games. but when I played it I fell in love with it. plz do get this app.,1
when ever I go it always makes me force close the app and I cant play the app at all I try downloading again and it still doesn't work when I download the app again,0
"I first looked at the app reviews and one of them asked why it had four stars because they thought it was terrible.Then I saw a lot of other reviews about it being the best app ever, so I wasn't really sure what to exspect. Anyway, the app is fun and is ",1
"A very nice little draw/paint program. Even has an undo button, unlike a lot of free drawing programs.A good selection of brushes.If you want a nice little doodling program then give this a try.It would help if those who review Android apps would indicat",1
"It was an ok drawing app until it froze the background color.  It has the basic brush types (round, square, spray etc.) You can choose colors and sizes for your brush. However,  when I tried to change the background color it froze on the third color choi",0
Even the kids have a good time with this one no matter how old they are. Take it to appointments with you. I guarentee you won'thave to wait. When ever you have something to do and aren't bored it seems like they take you in right away. Try it.,1
this is agreat game i find myself stuck to it awesome its a great time saver i love it don't hate on this app,1
When I tried it the first time I thought it is not hard so I was on the part where you have to press red white blue and green I pressed the colored letters and I lost but then I tried it a different yay and still did not work so I stopped playing this ga,0
I dislike this app because it is not very funny.  It's not even to see if you are smart. I think any app would be better than this. Now you know why it's FREE.,0
"got past first level and then got stuck! no matter what I do, it doesn't let me past that question! don't wast time or memory on this thing! :/HOPEFULLY THIS WAS HELPFUL",0
this game is so stupid! if u bother to get this.. u will regret it and delete. so don't get it and save 20 mins of your life.,0
"I only got this because I didn't want to spend money for the moron test. The game has almost all of the same questions as the Moron test, and it looks like these people did this on word 1997 there are no pictures or any background its just unapealing. Th",0
I completed the game but it was very challenging. A game like this deserves 5 stars even though it was short.,1
when I read the reviews I thought that cant be that bad but it is so don't get but nobody is going to stop you,0
after the 6:45 clock don't press the arrow that says checkpoint instead look for the next written to the side of the screen in small letters press that and you go on to the next question which is not a repeat question I hope this was helpful,1
This game is not fun at all!!!! After about 10 questions this was uninstalled. I think the Moron test is way better. I would rate this a zer0 if I could. Boringest game EVER!!!!!!!,0
I finished the app so I know what to do. At the white screen were it says FINISH. Press it. I know it says that  u failed but it's a trick. On the right hand corner in red but really tiny it says FINISH.then u have finished the game. YOUR WELCOME,1
"This seems like its supposed to be good but its soooooooo not. pathetic copyoff of moron test (which is actually good. moron test, that is)",0
The game is the same every time. There's 4 or 5 questions that you have to answer. You loose every time. I know  this because me and my sister did a test on it.,0
I was playing this app and I acidently hit back and it made me restart so I did but then it kept saying I got the Answer wrong when I gave the same answer as before.Bad app. and as said before copy of Morin test.,0
okay I know this might be really stupid and I am a loser soooo the first stupid question kept on calling me a loser.  I HATE THIS GAME SSSSSOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!,0
"I enjoy this app and i have no idea why so many people cannot figure it out. Yes, it takes some OBSERVATION of every screen you meet and maybe some patience, it is still possible to beat the game if you are smart enough. It will call you a dummy until yo",1
It's. horrible! I didn't get it Cu's I read that it was a total ripoff. it's a copycat and boring game!! just remember that u not a moron or idiot or a loser cuz that game is a total lie and copier justso u no!!!!!,0
THIS GAME SUCKS. ITS JUST A COPYCAT OR THE MORON AND STUPID TESTS. DON'T BUY IT ITS JUST A WASTE OF YOUR KINDLE SPACE,0
How do the finish to finish is when it says loser there's a finish in the corner you wok n lol,1
I played it until I got to the press number six page I couldn't get it it's also a copy of the first game the Moran test and the stupid test also its calls you loser if you fail!  Deleted it with a hour of use. Do not get this app,0
So cool and funny is like your in funny town my life is so cool with this thing us ha,1
this app is fun if you have nothing to do. i have beat this app so i decided to test my friends! this app will get you hooked and you wont want to stop until you beat it.,1
this app is plain and a rip off of the moron test it just looks like something a child made AWFUL APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU LIKE STUPID GAMES thank you,0
"The game is interesting.... for five minutes. Then, you get a question wrong, it says &quot; LOSER! YOU FAIL!&quot; and then you have to start over. And when I say start over, I don't mean start the level over. I mean THE WHOLE GAME! then, you have to do",0
This WIDGET is all I need........................................................)............... Get it it is a widget and not an ape I hope all the people that complain of not opening know how to operate a smart phone,1
I use this app every day. It's a very convenient app since I keep it on my desktop. I highly recommend it.,1
"This app did nothing for me.  In fact, i deleted it pretty soon after installing it.  Sorry to the developer that i can't say anything positive.",0
"I got this because the icon says 76%, not rounded to the lower tenth, however the widget only shows remaining life in increments of ten. Very misleading.",0
I keep the icon on my main home screen so I can easily control GPS and WIFI. Also shows what apps and tasks use the most battery.,1
does exactly what it claims and is far more accurate than stock battery icon in the corner (galaxy tab). often my stock battery icon will show full battery all the way down to 80% or so but this shows you how much you actually have.,1
"This does what it promises to do and is a simple and small widget. Not sure why all the haters gotta hate, if you don't like the permissions then don't load the app. It works just fine for me!",1
"Installed it so i could have a visual as well as a numerical display of remaining battery but it doesn't refresh, i plugged my phone up to the charger and completely charged it but the widget showed it was still charging and only at 56%, uninstall lg est",0
I know you can dig around in settings to find out the amount of battery remaining and what is using up your power. But to know your usage at a quick glance is beneficial. This does not tell you what is using up your power but will give you a snapshop of ,1
Just what i needed.  i dont know why there is no option to display battery life percentage on the Android os.  the little green battery that changes to orange isnt very useful,1
I've used this app in my last two smart phones. These new Smart phones take so much power and most times need recharging befor the end of the day. This app keeps you up to date on the battery status. Recommend to all.,1
why does a battery indicator require my gps location how crazy is this bull crap if you think about it.,0
This is the first app I've ever downloaded that I wasn't able to open in the year that I've had this phone. Lame. HTC Incredible 2.2 Froyo.,0
"not only does this application not work, but it occludes important safety issues surrounding xray use from the public, which is a real travesty. this app should be removdd from the app store",0
SHOWED THESE TO FRIENDS MOST OF THEM GOT FOOLED BUT ONE ****** GUY CAUGHT THE TRICK LOL NICE FOOLIN APP.,1
Did you even look at the description? &quot;Prank&quot; and &quot;joke&quot; doesn't make sense to you? Let me know when you decide to go back to kindergarten and learn to read.,0
This was not as good as it appeared.  A waste of my time to download and navigate.  I deleted it as soon as I got it.,0
I tried many ways to get it to work for me but it didnt. So I say that you should be careful getting it,0
Why does this game have two stars overall? It should have on e it doesn't even move where u move it! Horrible game doesn't show my foot either!,0
This app doesn't let you scan yourself. It's an app to prank your friends. When I talked to the creator of this app he said that he wanted an app that lets you prank your friends with an X-Ray. I asked him why didn't he make an app that actually works by,0
Corny. Now I don't know how to uninstall it. Can someone help me please ? Kids might could fool each other once with it.I really dont want this on my phone. How do I get it off? No uninstall button.,0
this app does nothing. it has no point and doesn't work. It is a waste of time and space! I recommend you don't get this app,0
"very poor quality, only 2 body parts to choose from. hard to scroll because of bad sensitivity to movement. needs work first then could be a three star app. evo 4g",0
"This is so lame I was pointing it at the ceiling then pressed left, and right foot,right hand, and left hand but it still showed the hand even though I wasn't pointing at it.",0
Should have listened to the other reviews.  This is just plain dumb.  I can understand it's meant as a joke and it can't actually xray.  But it doesnt even pull that off properly.  Any time u spend downloading is just time you will never get back and wis,0
I hate this app it's just a pic of a X-ray hand and that's it awful app :( awww man I have to keep writing done well bye,0
"When I tried to play it, it didn't even move. A waste of my space is all it is to me",0
"This app sucks OK so today is October 6 2013 Sunday and I broke my finger TuesdayOctober 1 and it still has not healed well it says my finger is perfectly fine. Oh and get this, xrayed my foot and it says there are three joints in my big toe m and I did ",0
Not even a real app to tell you the truth. Its not worth anyone's time.I would delete this app from my memory if i could thats how bad it is.,0
FYI we all read the description and we knew it was a prank app. I tried it on all my friends and NONE OF THEM FELL FOR IT. So yeah this app is defiantly not my favorite.,0
RIP OFF. Don't think it's gonna scan anything. All it does is let you look at the foot or the hand. And it's some other persons hand or foot. Ok well just dont get it,0
"This app is only for entertainment. Plus it is a waste of time for using your Amazon coins for silly reasons to scan FAKE prints. This may be for children like -4 but otherwise, it's still, don't waste Amazon coinsStay cool :D",0
well i haven't even tried it out yet but from all of yalls reviews i really don't know so wish me good luck!!!,0
"with all the bad reviews and having only one star, how can this possibly be in the top 100, let alone number 16. I don't get it.",0
what kind of a crap game is this it sucks big time man DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!? DEAD SERIOUS RETARDED. THIS DOESENT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR,0
Guys you think It is stupid. Wow. It is to prank your friends I mean read the description. First read description you think you guys are so cool judging an app make a better one then if you think this one sucks,1
THIS app (says in the beginning)its an illusion not an actual xray scanner.also its for people to prank others and you can only pretend scan your right hand or left foot! talk about SUPER LAME..might wanna mention this application!!!,0
"Looks pretty fake, but it's actually kind of cool. More of a one time app. Not really going to go back to it much, since it's just a silly app.",1
This is horrible.  The ads are so big you can't even play with it.  The graphics are fuzzy.  The calibration is a joke.  Just a poor app.  Even at free it is no good.,0
its pretty weak... the calibration is off and it is just a waste of time. won't entertain anyone at a party. unbelievable. just plain sucks.,0
IT DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WILL NOT SHOW U UR HAND WILL SHOW U A RANDOM X-RAY OF SOMEONE ELSE'S!!!!,0
"Unless I missed something, I don't find any practical use for this item except maybe have a laff or to.Not for me.",0
"This game Was not fast enough.  Did not like it, so didn't play it.  Nothing else to say on this subject.",0
This isn't real and it really doesn't work so I say don't get this app it sucks like crap and I thought it would actually work,0
i loaded it and pranked my geniuos son even. i am going to have fun with this one. takes about 5 mins of practice to mater all the tilting. i did it zig zaging like i was scanning. I even yelled yo hold still. lol,1
Pointless. Not realistic at all. Nothing good to say about this one. I guess you have to be into this sort of thing.,0
My kids love it. It is fun to play with. It would be better if it had kid size on it.,1
This is the worst app ever all that you can do is scan your right foot or your right hand. I don't even think that was my hand. :(:(:(:(:(,0
I just got this as interest.. it didn't last long and just wasnt that cool to play with so it is gone,0
I tried to scan my hand and it is fake and my foot but it won't let me so I can scan my hand,0
This app is a total waste of your time. The free version sucks just like the one for $.99. It's a rip off take my advice and don't waste your time,0
It was horrible my 5 yr. old brother knew it was fake from the beginning...it moves.on its own I don't recommend.it,0
I hate this app it the worst one in the world I wish I could remove it from all you good peaple it SSSSSUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!,0
It sucks. How do you scan your hand? All it has is a picture of a hand and tilt it. Deleting it now. Never download it. It sucks.,0
not worth downloadin. simple crap and not gonna convience your friends. doesnt show whole as shown photo. doesnt do as descibed. removd app within a minute from downloading,0
"it is a prank app that half the time you cant get into. DO NOT BUY, IT IS A WASTE OF STORAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"was stupid and didn't work, my son downloaded this to try and he didn't even like it so we uninstalled it",0
Not a X-ray A Scanner Just A Picture Of A Skeleton Hand With You Tilting Your Device Diffrent Ways To See More Of It Not Ya Hand In fact My Kindle Fire's Camra Was Looking At My Face It's A Rip Off Even Tho It's Free Because It Takes Up Space The Bought ,0
"Downloaded for a laugh, didn't think it would actually work (it doesn't, app even tells you on startup that its not real, which is fine). The problem is the calibration on the thing is off, I was tilting my phone all over the place and nothing was workin",0
This game is boring and I don't recommend that you get this game. This game is super LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Love Victoria,0
"slow startup, then once you select your options, the screen goes black and locked my phone up! had to remove battery. not a well written app.",0

"This is the funnest and Greatest Apps i have tryed so far. The downside is it's $4.99. but to me it's so worth it to see what you can create and see how much you can sell it for. it's a must buy! dont listen to the other comments, cause im telling you th",1

You should be ashamed. Although it's clear you have no morals and are unable to feel shame. I too will avoid your apps from now on; you've been added to the list.,0
You can't do anything but shape clay on the wheel and fire it. You have to buy everything else to decorate it. Total rip off!!!!!!,0
I don't  know why everyone hates this game it's  awesome not bad. i don't  get why you can't  just get everything with the game though.,1
"This game was fun at first. But when I was making my 3rd pot, my kindle suddenly froze. I had completely restart my kindle. If this is fixed, the game is really fun and I will give it 5 stars!",0
This game is wonderful even better since I got it free during app of the day I highly recommend this!,1
So many people have ready said it... IAP for paid app is just ridiculous...especially when said app is $5! And from what I've read this dev has one of those tricky tricky business models that sold this app as premium with all content and then pulled an u,0
"I have seen this game from infinite dreams for some time now,  but the $4.99 price was kept me away. For a FAOTD this was a great surprise! I haven't set down my phone since I downloaded this game. Make a piece,  sell it,  and buy more colors and materia",1

But Infinite Dreams needs to update it and add more because they've lost their base fans.  Most people aren't going to pay $5 for an app.  I see a lot of opportunity to work around that.  Even though everyone will complain about ads there's a better chan,1
The product description states explicitly that there are real money spending options in this app. And that parents can limit & control that through menu settings. NO such menu is accessible from within this app's menu on a Kindle Fire! So be forewarned y,0
I fell in love with this app over a year ago on my ipod and I am so happy it works great on my Kindle Fire! I also love being able to post my creations on to my Idreams community page so even after I sell them I still have them and can show them off!! GR,1
"I LOVE THIS! it is so unique! there are always things to do! there are quests that give you inspiration when youve run out! its like nothing else ive ever played! i am so glad that i got this when it was free, but it is worth the money others have to pay",1
"Here we go again, more and more greedy developers everyday. Why would anyone sell you anything incomplete is just wrong. Charge one fee and make both you and the buyer happy. Greed is evil!! Not recommending this app to anyone and i hope your ratings go ",0

This was a wonderful free app of the day. I have seen some reviews that you may have posted and I found out how to paint the pot and add decorations. Paint: Slide your finger up and down the pot. Slide it on the same spot again to make it darker. Brushes,1
This game is one of my favorites really it is so if u like creating unique and cool pottery this is for you! I would definetly not listen to the haters this game is 1 everybody should get! 5 stars,1
I could not open it. You can do it for real in the first place. I think it was very stupid. Please do not get this app it is not worth it at all.,0
"This game is great for future artists. People who enjoy pottery will really like this game. As you sell more pots and earn more money, you can unlock more.",1

Really? Again? In app purchases? Here let me give you a star and feel free to use it as a suppository.,0
"I thought I'd hate it, but since it was featured as a free app today, I snagged it. I probably wouldn't pay for it, but it is incredibly fun. I can't put it down. I can see myself purchasing the add-ons though. It makes me want to make real pottery.To pe",1
This is a pretty robust app that can be played in relatively short bursts. I don't plan on using the in app purchases and haven't needed to. anyone complaining about IAP has obviously not tried the game at all and has no concept of how developing and mar,1
totally fun! I don't even know how to get the in app purchases but this app works fine without it,1
"I like this app. It is fun to play and very relaxing. I have finished the app twice, and am waiting for an update.",1
"This review is just to balance out the fake 5-star reviews put on by the greedy devs. But then, a $5 app which wants you to keep spending even more in-app deserves zero stars.",0
I think that this game is the best game that's ever been invented and I love this game and I play it everyday,1

I got this app on my kindle fire and it works great. I didn't have any problems or glitches or anything. its pricey but I think its worth it for the hours of fun it gave me.,1
"I grabbed this as the faotd a while back, and I don't regret it at all. I enjoy the game as a way to relax, and be creative at the same time.My 4 year old loves this game too, and creates some amazing stuff. The only complaint I have is that my 4 year ol",1
I think that this app is great. It is very fun for people who love art. It also gives you a lot of selections of how you want to create your pottery. Get this app it is great. (Written by my granddaughter),1
this game is so fun u need to get this game now I got this game for free but if I didn't then I would still pay 5dollars for this game this game is great,1
this game is a very good time killer and it is very. fun!!! you should get it because it gets your imagination out!,1
its so much fun its like u have ur own pottery business don't listen to the bad reviews get it.,1
Just because its going to premier as FAOTD does not mean that you must cripple your app's rating by charging more. Treat a FAOTD as a time to get people to try your app and raise your rating. Think of the future not the present. Now no one will buy your ,0
I love potery so now i dont have to waite so long for it to come out and i can be me. it may seam like a wast of money and time but it is fun when yu play it alot.,1
it is annoying sell the app for more money then don't sell for 4.99 then raping customers for more money afterwards,0
I don't see anything wrong with this game. So I don't know what's up with everyone saying crap about it. I love it. Its very addicting and it sure does kill time.,1
I love this app so much its so fun I play it every night!! you got to get this!! what this app is about you make pottery!! you make the shape then you color it and more!!!!,1
"It is so exciting to create pottery that you wouldn't go out and do. The option to sell it is awesome. What a great, fun pass time.",1
"What a fun, relaxing and entertaining activity this is.  I am so tired of all the hack n slash, tower defense, city builder, match three, hidden object, boring word games, games that offer no creative challenge, no opportunity to stretch your imagination",1
"I really don't understand the IPA hate. It doesn't make the game any less fun, and that's what a review is about. This game makes incredible use of the touch screen. It can be as simple or complex as you'd like it to be. It actually got me interested in ",1
Started Out Free Then This App Stopped Working.. Said I Need To LOg In To Amazon To Fix. ThenI Seen That They Are Making You Pay To Play...  Even If You Unlocked Items...  Idiotic Business Model.. Way To You Customers Off And Get A Bad Rep.  I Let My 4 Y,0
"I don't know what problems everyone else is complaining about, but I love the game. Cute concept and fun to play. Not too hard and not too easy. If you don't want to spend real money on the IAP, then don't. Duh.",1
So far the app is pretty good and ranks between a 4 and 5 star app. When and if I find the In App Purchases I will no longer use the app and delete it from my Kindle Fire. Asking for $4.99 for a game and then pushing IAPs is uncalled for and I do not end,1

you do not need to spend any real money on anything at any time.  I have actually played the game all day unlike so many childish people that reviewed the game based on what others said without even downloading it let alone playing it.  if you have never,1

this app is amazing. although the other reviews say that it is such a bad app its really not. yes I agree it is more of a hobby but still wither way it is really fun.,1
"So, normally this app is $5. and even after paying for it, you STILL have to pay even more REAL CASH to obtain items to play.  IAP's are the scourge of our time and we need to come together and boycott them  ALL! STAY AWAY!!",0
"This is less of a game and more of an activity. That being said, its a fairly enjoyable way to kill off some time on a lazy afternoon. Making the pottery allows you to tap into your creative side, and, tho the actual modifications you can make to the pot",0

Great Game !!!! Lots of pots to make ! Very fun.  YourAble To Make cups from Coffee Cups to jars To FoodBowls.,1
We HAVE to boycott IAP! Scamming us out of even more money in game . . . Don't think so!,0
"IAP does not always equal bad. There are TONS of games out there that offer the option to pay real money to get things. You know why? Because people are lazy, and would rather spend some pocket change to get it rather than work their way through the game",1
"I have no idea what the negitive reviews are about. I got this for free and I think its great.There is an Option to buy added tools later in the game, but so what. Its fun, there's no time limit,and no mess. Great App!",1

This game is pretty poor.  It stinks that the pay version has IAPs.  Its also very repetive and boring.  I do not recommend.,0

This is a really fun game but sadly it keeps crashing. Its unplayable. I hope they fix it. Its about matching two things to help you advance. Like you pick water and earth and that will give you a new element to play with. As I mentioned. the game crashe,0

This is a cool game. It is harder than it looks. There is currently a crash problem but I am sure it will be fixed with next update. This is sort of a puzzle type game and I love this type of a game on phones and tablets.,1

I love this game but this app sucks big time. it keeps force closing and I cant even play it. I fell cheated. hopefully they will fix this app and it can be played to its completion.,0
"Game is a bad rip off of Alchemy, which is far superior to this garbage, the game teases other chapters or modes but doesn't explain how to access them. App really isn't worth a try, 2.5 stars as an average review is too generous.",0
I loved it I was able to get going really fast. Also the hints helped me through times that I was confused in. I also really like the extra quests along the way. Yes it's easy toPlay because I beat it in under a week.,1

Doodle God is a game where u create &quot;elements&quot; such as airplanes or cars. this is one of my favorite apps which seems very fun to me. I love this app,1
"When I saw the game, it just looked like a easy game.y but as I got into the game,it looked fun and addicting. And I was right and right now, I'm on episode 2, with 111 creations and 15 groups too.",1
"A totally unique fun game. I always only get free apps. Don't deny a lot of you don't do the same. After I played this free version, I HAVE to buy the full version.",1
In my opinion it's great because you can turn off all the inappropriate stuff in the settings and you can make cool things great for a 9 year old :D,1

"Severely lags making the game unplayable. I have used the free version on ICS, and it was pretty fun. I haven't tried this version on any of my other devices, but at this point I will just uninstall and wait for an update.",0
This game best mirrors an actual pinball table.  I play it constantly.  I would recommend to anyone as their top pinball game.,1

This is a great solitaire game. I love having it on my Kindle Fire. So easy & so entertaining and so easy to play..,1
"cards too small, not as workable or customisable as I like. it is OK for a quick game, but I like playing for longer periods of time",0
This type of solitaire is what I like best and I found it at Amazon.I can take it with me anywhere. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD.I would recommend it to anyone who likes solitaire.,1
I enjoy playing solitaire and have for many years. It is convenient to play on the computer. My sight is not as good as it used to be so being able to see the cards on the computer is a plus.,1

I like this great game.  Please try this great game.  I really enjoy this great game.  great game.  try this.,1
Plain old sol.  This is an easy to use game that even gives hints when you are stumped and ready to quit.  It will deal hands that can be beat or random deals.  For the price it can't be beat.,1
Its boring and confusing! If I could rate this app NO stars I would. Why don't they offer no stars?I DO NOT recommend this app/game at all.Don't get it!When or if you get this game and hate it ....... don't complain because I warned you!!!,0

No good. Do not get this app. Don't even know how it made it in app store. Samsung fascinate. Delete and never come back. :),0
they say that it is free and you play maybe two or so levels and then you can't play anymore unless you buy the whole game so really not worth taking your time to dowload on anything unless you want to actually buy the game after a few mintues of playing,0
Loved this game!!!!  All strategy games are fun but thought this one was really fun and kept me entertained for quite a while.,1
if you guys are complaining I think you are crazy. Mine worked fine like the one on the computer. There is no difference. It may not have worked for you people but it worked fine for me. YOU WILL NEVR MAKE ME COMPLAIN!,1
"This game is way to hard and it is boring after awhile of playing it, so I don't have it on my Kindle fire",0
This farm game is very mediocre. Actually it sucks. The better farm game is Papaya Farm and its free to have the full version. Download it to your Android or iPhone and use referral code Steam007 to get 300 papayas plus some bonuses.,0
"The game only let me play one level before it shut down. I was considering buying the full version if Iiked the free version, but I'm staying away from this!",0

I wish I had read the reviews before buying. First bad app I've bought.  Don't waste your money.  What else can I say?,0
Maybe my luck has been better. The app works great. Facial recognition works fine and end result is hilarious. Very realistic too.,1

"loaded this to my kindle, nice to be able to listen to some shows that way, great app and it is free",1
Does exactly what it would do on a laptop but now I could use it on my phone.  Easy to navigate.,1
U- Stream app works great. It allows streaming content on U-Stream on a Kindle Fire that was unable to watch by just going to the U-Stream website. (Kindle users store this app on your cloud storage so as to not use up your internal memory.),1

I love the rdio service and this app does a great job of letting me access the content. The streaming works well and the offline listening is great.,1
"Web, mobile and tablet all work great with radio -- feels less bloated that Spotify as an experience and is great with its offline mode.  Feels like I have my music collection in the cloud.",1
"Just so we're clear, Rdio is paid subscription service for streaming music. It's comparable to Spotify, though I feel like Rdio has a better selection of songs. I switched from Spotify to Rdio and haven't looked back. The app works well and is organized ",1
did not like how this website was disorganize because it was difficult to find the songs.  Then the free songs they diplayed were terrible.,0
Music more music Rdio has great selection and customization. Only if they could get some ACDC and METALLICA that would be AWESOMENESS..,1
I don't really get the point of this.  All the music seems to be what they want to offer as apposed to finding music I like.  They also bomb your inbox with useless mail.,0

The app itself works great.  I got the two week free trial on my Kindle Fire and was very pleased with it.  But I was disappointed to find out that it was $10 A MONTH to use it on a tablet or mobile device after the two weeks were up.  That's $120 a year,0

"These crossword puzzles were just what I've been looking for! Not too many cryptic ones readily available and these were perfect..not too easy, but not so hard as to make you lose sleep over them. I loved 'em. Thanks for thefreebie! Will definitely pay a",1
"I am an immense fan of cruptic crosswords and this app, even its free version was excellent.  I recommend it highly.",1
"Extremely hard and gratiflying,to play makes you think and think again...love it to the max....buy it try it do it..",1
"Cryptics are crosswords with complicated clues.  Rather than just test your word knowledge, they also test your creativity.  You should be able to find solving techniques on the web.  Highly recommended.This set of puzzles include some easier ones, and p",1
A nice little app which is a useful time waster when waiting for things to happen etc. A well constructed little program.,1

My husband and I have found this to be invaluable. I never thought I'd pay for an app but this one was worth every penny.,1
This app will not run on an Android.  I was going to put it on my phone but it would not load.  So it is of no use if you have a droid.,0
"I only had this app on my phone for a week or so and I could never get it to work, right. I'm sticking with RunKeeper!",0
"it is not working with sign in with the ap ANDi tried online WTH .  this looks like a cool ap, hope they fix. Samsung Instinct  2.2 OS",0
I signed up for map my run for a run streak challenge...I do like it a lot and it works well for me but one thing I wish I could do is to adjust the verbal updates....I am a time and distance junky so I would like to hear updates more than every mile LOL,1
This product didn't work very good for me.  I live in a very small rural area and it kept telling me that I was running around the lake that I clearly wasn't running around. Not for me.,0
i couldn't set up the account.  i hit &quot;set up&quot; and nothing happened ...four times...nothing happened.  shame too...i really wanted to log my rides,0
When I tried to install it said it was done. But it is not showing up anywhere on my phone. I went back into the amazon app store and it says install pending. I tried everything to get it to change status. powering off the phone wouldnt change the status,0
"This app is great. I started using it in July 2013. By keeping track of my rides, distances, elevations, calories burned, etc. I have been able to stay motivated and loose 30 pounds. As a reward to myself I rode a metric century charity ride and was able",1
I find myself playing this alot- fun easy tilt game works great on Kindle Fire. I can't ski in real life-this is a good substitute(-:,1
So I love skiing an whenever I cant do it I play this great substitute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT GET IT NOW!!!!!!!,1
This app and the hundreds like it help hold my daughter's interest in her Kindle. If she is happy then I am happy.,1
horrible app sucky graphics don't buy it. urhdhsbsjdbd dudgeon dbehe dish dhhshd shbsheh shahs horrible stupid hshd shahs shshhd jdb,0
"I absolutely love this game, it's one of my favorite.  There enough challenge to hold my interest but it's also winable.  Warning...this game can be addicting, in a good way.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1
love this game but one add keeps popping up.  also cant figure out how to put initials in.  it really is addictive.,1
"This game is as much fun as playing slot machines and you are not at risk of losing money.  Simple to play, but very entertaining.",1
Had never play this one and sure doenjoy it lots...It is easy and fun..Get it you will enjoy it too..It free too..,1
"I love hidden object games, and card games too!  This one is a good one to pass the time.  I love the &#34;quickness&#34; of the game, and you are only playing against yourself.  Lots of fun!  It's a great game!",1
This is a relaxing game. I love playing this when I want something simple to play. I play it alot. Give it a try.,1
Have been playing since got my Kindle.  Love it.  Addicting! Shared with family and they also can't stop.  Just don't understand why the name is Home Run??,1
There are several games that I have loaded and it tells me it is already in my library but I'm unable to find it on my Kindle.  I don't know if I need something else loaded first????,0
I find this game fast and a lot of fun to play.  Euchre is a game I play often with friends and find this good practice.,1
"I love Eucher but this was too busy. Deleted it right away, there are better Rucher games out there. Yuk",0
"I like playing Duchenne but there was something about this app that just didn't appeal to me, so I deleted it.",0
"I didn't like this verson of Euchre at all. I ended up getting rid of it and finding another version. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have.",0
this is an awful version of this game.  ads after EVERY hand?  ridiculous!!!  and the the game was over after 3 hands?  waste of time!,0
"At first this game was frustrating because there were no examples of a completed puzzle, but I muddled through.  Will be posting pictures of what Sea Wolf Bar #1 and #2 look like completed.  Solution #1 is a star, I'm thinking it's supposed to be a starf",1
I've not played a puzzle game like this before. It's a simple concept but can be quite a challenge. The closest game I know to compare this to is Picross without the numbers.,1
I love these kinds of puzzles its very challenging and addictive as well. if you get stuck on a problem look at the lamps and the strings turn. try to make them fit into places naturally. I'm stuck on Mon Ami Cafe 7/8.,1
"I really enjoy this game, because it is non-threatening (not timed) and easy to play, yet it stretches my mind to find the best solution for the most points.",1
This app was slow and the graphics crude. Deleted it. Sorry but there are much better free apps out there.,0
When i tried to use this game it takes over the kindle and i could not get out of it unless i turned kindle off.,0
This is a fun albeit simple little game. I can waste time playing it for hours. It can be quite addictive for sure.,1
"I am hopelessly addicted to this game. My husband had it on his machine and said that I should try it, and now I am addicted. I am extremely pleased with this game.",1
"This is a great games, it really make you think in what you are doing. I love playing this game",1
I love the Jewels type games.  This one was definately NOT up to the Jewels Star level....it looks to be a cheap imitation. I have already deleted it off my Kindle.,0
This version is not as challanging or responsive as &#34;Bejewelled&#34; Other jewel games are around that will play much better.,0
"I am totally enjoying this game, it is very similar to bejeweled except that you can move on the diagonal with this game which makes it a lot more fun",1
this game was really really slow. if it was faster I would love this game. I wouldn't get this game. sorry.,0
"Great game to keep your mind going and thinking, I work with this everyday. A must have for anyone who like thinking games.!",1
When you are playing the game everything is like it is in slow motion. I would not recommend this game.,0
I downloaded a few of these games for my mother-in-law because she kept killing my battery on my phone so now she kills my kindle LOL!,1
"My husband loves this game. I do not. For some reason, i just have a hard time figuring it out, but as long as my husband likes it, it will remain on the Kindle.",1
I think this is an Easy Game to play.  It is Challenging to me.  I Enjoy playing it often and usually play each time I pick up my Kindle Fire.,1
Too hard to make matches.  Needs more instructions.  Played several times before I found out you could make matchs diagonally.,0
"Love all the jewels, gems, and diamond games where you match up three or more.  Have lots of fun and get hooked.  Don't want to stop",1
"Love this game when I just want to relax.  It's fun, challenging and relaxing to me.  I really enjoy playing it.",1
Love playing games and this is a great one. Easy but not too easy! Great price~! Would recoomend this to all the people who love to play games on device's,1
"It is the next best thing to Bejeweled. It is a lot of fun to play. plus it is free. Marilyn Remus, Michigan",1
I enjoy this game and like that you can move diagonally. It can be come addictive and your other work doesn't get done.,1
THIS GAME IS VERY FUN TO PLAY AND YOU CAN REALLY GET HOOKED ON IT. I FIND MYSELF NOT WANTING TO PUT MY TABLET DOWN WHEN I PLAY.,1
Classic Jewels is a lot of fun and captures your attention right away.  Cannot put it down once started.  Don't start if you are short on  time as it can be so fascinating that you won't put it down.,1
You can play this game for hours and not get tired of it.  It is challenging to find the most gems in a row to earn more points.,1
"I love this game, Bejeweled 2 was my favorite game like this, but after playing this I think it's as good or better. Most games like this don't move diagnal but this one does and it adds to the exitment. A+",1
Prefer the Bejeweled game I've played on my sons I-Pad.  This one on the Kindle is very boring. Hope the Kindle will soon have another option. I've tried them all that are currently on the Kindle. None are fun for me.,0
I truly enjoy playing this game. I highly recommend classic jewel for peoples enjoyment. It gives me lots and lots of pleasure.,1
This game really gets your mind and eyes working.  I truly would recommend this game to all of my family and friends.  I have a hard time quitting this game.,1
"I downloaded it and figured it was  a lame Tetris ripoff from its icon. Little did I know, it was a outstanding game. Its a really cool little game and very tricky on some levels. I'd easily say this game is a good deal for .99.I would say for anybody lo",1
you should give out 5free hints every time you want to and you should have a cheat app for it,1
"This game is great if you want to exercise your mind and waste time. If you are a visual learner, then this game is just what you need.",1
"I like the concept. I thought it was another Tetris clone, but I clearly misjudged that assumption. I got this for the free app of the day, but if you're a someone who loves puzzles that make you think a little hard, but not too hard, this game is for yo",1
Just bought this before it went free :( Works great on the Motorola Xoom (Android 3.1). Fun and addicting. Great puzzler.,1
This is one of those love/hate things for me. Some levels can be done on my first try and then I work on others until I am ready to throw the phone ... yet can't just walk away.,1
I love this game!!  It's awesome fun.  Screen calibration seems a bit off but it runs fine on a Coby Kyros 7024.,1
"This is the perfect example that for a game to be good it doesn't always have to have 3rd graphics and hog all your phone's resources.This game is great,  simple concept,  and good implementation. Keeps me busy whenever I have a little time to kill.Well ",1
"Amazon has never been updated. V 1.1 released in March, android market is on v 1.3 last updated in October. Buy elsewhere, if at all.",0
I hated tangrams as a kid. But for some insane reason I cant stop playing this! I keep going and going and going and it has a song like Tetris that doesn't drive you to play or away. It's burned in my mind! Can't stop playing... Must finish game... Five ,1
This is a very fun and challenging game. Starts off very easy and gets to be downright difficult. Works great on droidx.,1
"An excellent little puzzle game, reminiscent ofTangoes, except you cannot rotate the pieces, which actually makes it a bit easier.  It's a great game for exercising the creative portion of your brain.  It's also one you can pick up and put down very quic",1
beyond fun! beyond addicting! challenging and just plain awesome! tetris only m better! music is cool too and catchy. works flawless on my LG Ally. worth the $1!,1
Didn't think I would like it but I was wrong!  I started playing and the time flew! The game handles well and is not so hard that I just get  frustrated and quit! Great game!,1
I am enjoying this application quite a bit. simple but well done. the soundtrack is wonderful ad well. worth the price at 99 if you didn't get it free.,1
"Worth way more than a buck, and abso-friggin'-lutely worth a download when it's free.  I'm glad I snagged it when I did. :-DI'd recommend this to amybody who loves tetra/penta-mine style games.",1
"This game is very simple, but well executed. It&apos;s excellent as a time waster but engaging enough to play longer than 10 minutes. The art style is very nice.",1
This game is easy to start but gets increasingly difficult.  Reminds me of tangrams.  Simple UI. Choose light graphics or dark.,1
Love it. Simple concept executed perfectly. Why can't more apps be like this. It is a must have for thinkers.,1
"I'm a big fan of puzzle games, and this one has quickly become my favorite.  The clever use of 'tetris' like pieces and interesting puzzle shapes make this a must have!",1
Typical puzzle game with great controls.  Really I think the fact that you don't have to put your finger over the puzzle is quite innovative.,1
"well organized and thought out game, lures you in with easy puzzles then gets progressively harder. great free app for the day, and worth purchasing for those that, missed the window.",1
"This game really makes you think. I would have to say if Tetris was more puzzler than speed,  this is what it would be. Doodle Fit.Soundtrack is also very catchy. Would recommend to anyone. Well worth the $1.",1
"nice puzzler, graphics and controls are vey nicely done.  finally someone does drag and drop the right way, shifting the object out from under your finger so you can see what you're doing.",1
"At a buck for this app, you'll get your money's worth. It is a great way to fill a few idle minutes, though you may find yourself playing quite a bit more. The ""hand drawn"" style of the interface is whimsical and fun. Nice work, guys.",1
i love this game. it&apos;s simple but addicting- i do entire packs at a time! i try to solve without clues butfind myself needing them more and more as the puzzles get harder! i got thi as free app of day but would def spend a dollar for it.,1

"First levels are super easy, and I was worried that it would not be challenging.  Now that I am on the third level it sometimes takes me a while to complete just one puzzle.  I got it for free but I definitely think it is worth a buck or more.",1
I love this game so much on my phone but I would love it even more if I could have it on my kindle for free. so unfair :(,1

I downloaded this and haven't been able to put it down! Some are easy and some aren't. Good time waster!,1
Just a simple and beautiful game no bells and whistles but just a nice tablet puzzle game with quality simple graphics..,1

I'm addicted to this game. I got it when it was free but would have definitely paid .99 for it. Works great on my HTC inspire.,1

"Wonderful design, great graphics, easy controls. Music could use a little variety. Hope you Luke the game as much as I did.",1
"this is an entertaining game. I love puzzles, and anyone who enjoys a good brainteaser will love it. very satisfied. no technological lag or ads. definitely worth the 99 cents.",1

"I was ready to pass on this free app of the day since it looked like others I had tried. but I'm glad I didn't.Its a lot of fun, easy at first but gets challenging towards the end of the first round. It has a unique and fun concept to design of the game.",1
So much better than I expected from the pics.  Works well on my phone &amp; even better on my Asus Transformer tablet.,1
This game is extremely fun for those who like puzzle games. there are almost always a variety of ways to complete a puzzle and I enjoy that aspect of the game. I would recommend it if you love puzzle games.,1
"VERY ENTERTAINING, NEVER BORING, SMART DESIGN. I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR, BUT CANNOT FIND!  GREAT WORK, VERY CREATIVE!  THANKS!",1

"This game possess a challenge and you get hooked easily. thanks appstore for your free ap a day, but I don't think bosses will appreciate my inactivity at work.",1
This is a nicely designed and challenging puzzle-style game.  Kudos to the developer for creating a game that scales nicely to the Kindle Fire's screen.,1

"this doesn't look like my house at all. And the street is all wrong. and it's not even fun.I am not the developer, I promise.",0
i love the fact that people will fall apart over a cute live wallpaper and flame it to death as if it ruined their lives,1
"It's a cheery looking wallpaper. The customization options are pretty decent. I think there are way too many people walking about for suburb street, but other than that I can't fault this one. Looks great on the Asus Transformer.",1
"I love this wallpaper.  First, let's remember that this is wallpaper, not a game, so we can't give it a bad review for lack of complexity.  I mean, really, how complex of the wallpaper you have right now?It's a nice scene to have on the background of you",1
what makes you think that they even trying to get awesome graphics going. this could be the look they where looking for. all you have to do is look at the pictures and see that its cartoons. hell look at the wii!!!!,1
do not buy this app. it doesn't work on the HTC EVO phone. looked like a fun game too :(,0

I loved this game! It was impossible to put down! I wish there were more like it. It was challenging yet  not impossible.,1
I like puzzle games and this on is addictive.  Very much like bejewelled. You can compete with the computer or play solo. I've had it for about 2 weeks with no tech problems like freezing.,1
Absolutely love this app. Great casual game to pick up from time to time. A lot like bejeweled but a little more fun and challenging. Definitely can't go wrong.,1
Anyone who says this ends on 45 seconds sucks at this game. I got to level seven the first time I played. Cool game. Interesting idea!,1
"I think that this is a challenging, but additive app. It is a great way to pass some time. It's hard, but not overly so and it gets easier the more you practice. It's fun.",1
"like the old palm daisy game.not too hard, not too easy.a bit pricey, but not today.all in all a good effort.",1
This is most fun app i've downloaded off Amazon... I just can't get enough of this game. I love how it just keeps switching it up.,1
"I wouldn't pay $2.50 for this... $.99 seems more appropriate. but it is entertaining and not as bad as a lot of people are saying. wish there could be different modes of play, though.",1
This is a good game to fill some time. Starts real easy then gets a little tougher.Keeps me occupied for a while.,1
graphics are nice considering its just balls of color. sound effects and music aren't anything special nor are they annoying. Once you hit level ten things get very challenging relying far more on school than luck. My seven year old played and got to lev,1
great app. works well on Evo. addictive and unpredictable makes it challenging every game. well worth the money spent on it.,1
"This game is pretty nice if you like action puzzles.  Very Colorful, nice soundtrac and Fun to play.  It is not any super game but a simple Brain exercise style game that keeps you interested for awhile.  Thanks.",1
i really like this app. the graphics are absolutely stunning and the game is both addicting and challenging. definitely worth the download.,1
"I think my title says it all. Worked great on both my EVO 3D and my Galaxy tab. I prefer the galaxy tab because of the bigger screen size, but still carry it around on my 3D in case I have some downtime on the go. It takes a little bit to figure out how ",1

It's very frustrating when a game that requires you to do a reasonable amount of button mashing doesn't save your progress if you inadvertently press the back button.,0

The Fire is not intended for mapping and anyone that trashes this app because it doesn't work on a Fire is out of touch with reality. This app is solely and completely an alternative to Google Maps. It is not a replacement for Google Earth. While it will,1

The GPS & traffic MapQuest is fantastic.  It alerted me to road construction before I even got to it.  Easy to hear audio made following the directions easy as well.  I'm hard to impress and I fight to avoid techy stuff with a passion.  While the grandpa,1

"Mapquest works great for finding things, so long as you have a wifi connection.  However this is a limitation of the kindle, not the app.",1
I am pretty certain that you have to be locked into WiFi for this to even work remotely well.And I am.And it doesn't work well.I like Google Earth the most. This would be cool - and work MUCH better if it was live on the Kindle Fire and not searching for,0
This is a great app to have if you travel.  You can't beat a GPS when you're actually on the road but when it comes to planning a road trip it's great. You can view alternate routes and get an idea of how long your trip will take.,1
Great app! Very easy to use and has come in handy more times than I can count. I love it!,1
"When I need to find a place to go, I use this app. So far it has beenVery accurate and reliable. No complaints what so ever.",1
I was amazed at how easy it was to get directions and how much information was available.I usethis in all my travels now,1
"Mapquest never worked right, and don't they have fine print on all their maps that says they are not liable when their directions get you hopelessly lost? Seriously, look.",0
I like it Ican chose to use it on my kindle instead of getting on my  computer the only down fall not able to print out the directions,1
Not a gps but very handy.  I like being able to see how to get some where or give accurate direction.,1
"This App is nothing like the web based MapQuest.  Its hard as hell to find the button that will take you to &#34;get directions&#34; so you can enter your starting point, and then your end point.I DELETED IT.  IT WAS SOOOOOOO BAD.",0
If you use Mapquest online for your pc....even better on your phone and since Apple blew it with their maps. This is the equivalent...even better.,1
"This works, especially I am not good when traveling to places I am not familiar with. I need precise directions to get where I am going in a timely manner",1
I have used the Google map program on the web for years and have watched it develop from a sometimes useful program to a source of first resort for information on the location of just about any home or business.  The MapQuest app offers that capability a,1
I am an animal rescue and often have to give directions to my rescue from places I am not  familiar and have been able with MAPQUEST to give easy direct routing thanks to MAPQUEST. GREAT!,1

"Whenever I typed in directions on mapquest.com, the directions that they given were not very accurate and they also did not listed side roads.  Google Maps is better!",0
"After download to Fire, I turned on and there was a little car at my house.  Just like a paid for GPS.  Got map on several locations.  When off like the map is still there. Love it.",1
This program works the best for me.  Its clear and easy to read.  I wish I could use my kindle in the car!,1
"Great help for you when your in unfamiliar territory, I have resorted to this a couple of times. Thank you",1
"It is a great map app for Kindle, use it frequently, no problems on my new Kindle, it's a keeper",1
"It's just mapquest, lol.But I haven't found any kind of digital mapping system that works really well in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia.  This one is really no exception.  You just have to look at the map and figure out how to get where you are going",1
I love the way it is so accurate in locating your position and showing very clearly the routes available to get to your destination.,1
I needed to get direction and mileage for vacation. I could not get either one. Had to get a different web site from my son.,0
I deleted this app since it gives the wrong location when I put in our address.Instead I go to google maps using the silk browser.,0
I like this app a lot. Not sure why there are so many low reviews. I don't expect much when my device is wifi only with no gps. So basically this is still a great tool for planning trips at home before I leave. And maybe there's not a ton of offline opti,1
This is better than any paper map because it has up to date streets and subdivisions.  Great for garage saling.,1
"This was downloaded to my Kindle, and even seemed to act like my Kindle had a WI FI  and GPs to follow the pickup  and show  maps as I walked down the street!  I must have been picking up from houses I was passing!  ??",1
"Not as good as google maps, runs much slower and graphics less refined even on a tablet, not sure why anyone would use this unless they didn't have a choice (I'm looking at you kindle fire)",0
"I use this on my Kindle Fire. I'm not always on Wi-Fi, but when I can connect this app has a lot of info. available, especially for being a free app..I would recommend this to anyone.",1
"Downloaded this free app, went to look for it in app library and it wasn't there.  Went back to re-download it again and was told it was already in my app library.  Again I go to look for it, and no Mapquest App..As the kids like to say... FAIL!",0
"so great when local or traveling-it is simply great-whether driving or traveling by train or plane, this is the item to have with you",1
This application is very similar to the Web site.  It is easy to use.  This app would be helpful to anyone who needs to find an address.,1
Very informative  like that I can get map quest . On my kindle makes it convenient so I don't always have to . Use my phone would recomend to everyone,1
"Have always loved mapquest but now love that I have it on my Kindle. Everyone needs this app, execially when traveling",1
it worked great. did not stop cooperating it worked really really great for me to everyone that is thinking about getting it it is great,1
this app was a waste of time unable to get maps to where I need to travel. Deleted it as fast as I downloaded it could never get directions from Georgia to Phoenix&#60; AZ,0
I downloaded this app while I was lost in PA.  Within minutes I was up and running and in a stressful situation found my destination and a path to reach it.  You know an app is great when you use it in a panic and it helps.,1
"Not as many features as Google maps but it still get the job done. What makes this great though is that it seems to be more accurate then Google Maps and it is only 2MB so it runs fast, rock solid and hasn't locked or crashed on me yet. Wonderful app!",1
I am a truck driver and this helps out in planning this app works wonderfully. This has turned into one of my favorite tools,1
As long as you got internet connection to use with it it is somewhat useless. But I like that I can pull up last saved map without being online.,1
The gps part is not working. It keeps saying can't find your location. I just wished it would have worked.,0
This is a great app if you need direction. It is precise and fast. I would recommend the app. Thanks.,1
I didn't like this app because I wanted to be able to print the directions from my kindle. I couldn't find a way to do that so that's why I didn't like it.,0
I have only had this app a couple of days so far but looks good.  I tried it on a simple test to a store in town and it plotted the course perfectly and quickly.  Using on Kinkle Fire HD don't know how it will work in car with no wifi available I'll have,1
It is perfect for what I need.  I do a lot of searching and I use this almost every day.,1
"It put me right where I wanted to be, with miles to destination. Better than my TOM TOM, and no cost to me.",1

"I would think thatmost people know the computer version of this program & if you like that this is a must, pity that the Kindle has no GPS though so it dosen't work 100%",1
"love this app!!! have it for the kindle fire, works great! obviously not ALL features work, that would need mic 3g or cell signal and stanndered aneroid but it is still a great app.",1
I now have a navigation system that works through my Kindle without paying a fortune to have this added to my vehicles. I have the application with me in whatever car I am driving.,1
"I wanted a map that doesn't require GPS, since my Kindle Fire HD doesn't have that.  This somehow figures out you location using other methods, and will plot a course for you.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Well done MapQuest.",1
This will be very good on trips and that is the very reason I got it on mt tablet. thanks,1

So how does the app work? Where are any instructions.  Load the app in your Kindle and you can spend the next 8 hours trying to make it work. Very frustrating. Not straightforward. Maybe the instructions are hidden somewhere.,0
I really like the ease of making up different lists in this app. Easy to mark things off as they are completed and you can either delete them entirely or leave them to recall what you did.  I highly recommend this app for those who need to keep track of ,1

I tried this because I liked the other Glu games contract killer and blood &amp;glory-but couldn't get in to this one.  I found the touch joystick difficult to move my gunbrother where I wanted him to go.,0
I think that it could be a bit cheaper for buying guns and such...but other than that its a great game.,1
This game is really fun.  This is a good game for all ages and it is really hard to stop playing when you get good.,1
Super addictive.  One of the best games on the market. Controls are responsive. Graphics are great. Love it. Get it now,1

"Its really fun, controls jiffy at times but otherwise a great game, and the paid portion doesn't take ALL the good stuff away",1
This was an awesome game the guns are amazing this game held my attention for like I don't know just for a really long time,1
You can't fast forward or rewind. There is no volume control. Not very user friendly. I think I'll just keep listing on my iPod.,0
"Stops right in the middle of the program on the Kindle Fire.  Furthermore, once you switch apps there is no indicator in status bar or control.",0

This app seems incredible and I want to buy it. This review earns five stars. I love to draw so this app would be perfect for artists like me.,1
"Perfect for playing pictionary in a long car ride, or even just having a little Doodle time:) I&lt;3 this app its perfect for me, and my friends!!!!!!!!!!!",1
It's a wonderful app and awesome on kindle fire. Very advanced for a free app...but its also simple enough that a toddler can use it and choose different colors and brushes by themselves.,1

this game is confusing and just plain weird dont get it and save time. really don't get it I regret waiting three minutes trying to download it.,0

Beautiful app. Recipes move between portrait and landscape when they should and no force close. Downloaded video from within app as others suggested and no problems.Can't wait to try them.,1
I would have kicked myself if I saw this app having been free and not snapped it up. What a wonderful way to approach cooking instruction. Your cookbook is your shopping list is your cooking show is in your pocket. This may actually qualify as something ,1

I've never tried yoga before. I've been doing a lot of crossfit-style exercises and only downloaded this app hoping to get some flexibility back.  I love this app and I love yoga now. The app is great for beginners like me since it has a description of t,1
way too big for what it is. there's no reason for something like this to even be bigger than 1MB.,0

no thank you. I know its free and all but really? I think yall can do better. I mean yoga? fo reals?,0
that's what happens when you empower idiots to write reviews. app is what it says it is. take it or leave it. its not going to make you a gangster. its exercise for the mind n body.,1
"I love yoga but my schedule does not allow me to go to yoga classes often. This app not only brings the classes to me it is also cheaper than paying for classes. It is easy to follow, and you can choose your yoga style, difficulty level, and how long you",1
I actually paid for this app. It is totally useless because the measurements are inaccurate. total waste of money i deleted it.,0
Another round of ridiculous reviews.  One star because you don&apos;t play golf?  One star because it won&apos;t help find your way home?  Gimme a break.,1
"Remember, the gps is only a accurate as your hardware. The app has a quick and easy to navigate interface and even allows for new courses to be added. They thought of everything!",1

Keeps force closing on my HTC Thunderbolt. Looks like it would be a decent app if they update it and fix this problem.,0
What a coincidence that this was the app of the day when I was planning a golf trip. Very interesting concept (would work better with GPS balls) and found a few courses around my home I didn't even know about.No crashes or isses with the program and GPS ,1
"This app is the best thing since sliced bread!  Some of you may know me, my name is Tiger Woods. Last week I fired my caddy because of this app. I don&apos;t need that bum any more because this app does his job much better than he did. \n\nNot only is go",1

I unistalled immediately after I downloaded it. There seems to be a problem with it running and crashed my kindle.,0
There are various levels and even some free spins to boost your score.  You can cash out and apply your score to the next game .,1
Have fun playing these games. Can become addictive very quickly. Told all my friends about these fun games. Slot of fun,1
"This US very boring. It might be worth playing if it rewarded the pocket change it promised but just like every other game or app that's download ed d from Amazon, pocket change doesn't work. Not worth downloading or taking up space e . On your kindle",0
didnt like the game you might so give it a try. sometime people like stuff and i dont so give it a try,0
good way to pass the time. cant seem to ever lose. i play whenever i have a few minutes of down time.,1
this is a fun and addictive game once you start playing you wont be able to stop I would highly recommend this game,1
I really enjoy this game but I like to gamble and I wish you could play more coins at one time. also you should have another bonus game that comes up besides killing the turkeys. I play the horse race and scratch the card and the other but you do not win,1
"Just more of the same old pay to play come on. You pay out and get nothing in return, what a waste of time.",0
"This game is a fun way to practice your betting skills. It starts out small, but it will get better.",1
This &#34;Little Application&#34; is really a &#34;Big App&#34;It gives hours of pleasure.I love this game.It is just like a &#34;Casino&#34; on your Tablet.I would highly recommend this to all who like slot machinesGive it a &#34;10&#34; for the 777Try ,1

I play real slits fairly often and lose most of the time. This is realistic and you do not lose.,1
"At least in this free game, you win lots of (unfortunately) money!!! Lol.. well worth the download. Hope to see more as I go.",1
This is a really fun app and keeps me entertained when I am not able to go to the casino.,1
this is exactly what I was looking for! a lot of the other apps are confusing. I could do without the mini games though.,1
i didnt like the app it was very boring and there are planty of apps that have the same concepts that are alot more fun. sorry hope that helped,0

WHEN I TRIED TO SET AN ALARM IT KEPT GOING OF ALL THE TIME WHEN IT WASNT SUPPOSED TO. THIS APP. REALLY STINKS,0
"I tried other apps but this one has better options &amp; looks prettier.  Very versatile &amp; adaptable. However, I don't use the launch app option because it turns my volume off.",1
Didn't work junk not worth the download skip past this one don't waste space on your hard drive try to find something else,0
"this app is a hiden gem within apps, its great as an alarm, it is very flexible and has tons of features all for free!",1

"Very easy to use. Highly customizable. Of all the alarm apps I've tried (there's been many), this is the very best by far.",1
I tried and tried but no matter what I did I could not turn the sound off!! do not install this app it is a wast of time!,0
Great tool. I have been using it for over a year now. Itallows you to use music. Set multiple alarms. Also you can have your device volume seperate from alarm volume.,1
"Love this app. I especially like the hourly grand father clock chimes, although for some reason it occasionally chimes off the hour.",1
"Only alarm clock that has ever worked for me on a regular basis.. no worrying about the volume being turned down on a clock radio, you can set it to wake you up to any song on your phone, or to an app (supposedly like the weather forecast, but I can't fi",1
first I set it for 7 o clock then it woke me up but did not shut up so I deleted the app but it still has the alarm set and I don't know how yo turn it off.,0

I downloaded this app thinking it would be great. I tried it out but it didn't make sound. u would recommend not getting this app.,0
"I used the ad-supported version of this app for about 3 days before I went out and bought the no-ad version; not just to get rid of the slightly annoying ads, but to support the dev for making an amazing alarm app.  I find it mostly impossible to get out",1
I thought I would give it a try.Everytime I would set the alarm it would shut off or stop working.I couldn't get it off my Kindle soon enough!!!!,0
"installs and opens, but crashes when trying to edit an alarm. you can't use the app... i cant further review the app until this is fixed. Five stars when running on my Galaxy S II... :/",0
"I found it to be too obnoxious for me to deal with as an actual alarm, but I am looking into other ones that are similar.",0
I love this app. the one thing YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE TO DO is when your setting alarm make sure you set the dismissal. to turn the alarm off you can simply press a button or do a math problem to turn your alarm off. it has.anbutton so that you can play y,1
I really suggest you get this. its free and it still lets you use your music as a choice. and even more there's. setting where you can make it where you have to do math to dismiss it! clever,1
"I just wanted a basic alarm to set. I found some extra's that I didn't know I wanted. Love the nap button, and that I can adjust the snooze time.. Have this app on several devices.",1
I hate it I hate it I can never set a single alarm and it always says that it cannot stay stinken open sunbathing don't get this app ever,0
"I was going to use this as a travel alarm on a recent trip.  Tried to set it up and test it before I went, but I couldn't find the snooze when the alarm sounded.  It may have been there, but I couldn't find a way to shut it down, so I uninstalled it.  I ",0
"The app is a great alarm, and has many customizable options such as selecting your own music to wake you up. There is an option to do math to dismiss the alarm.",1

"If you think this is no good because you can't practice, it says &quot;math REF&quot; not &quot;math practice&quot;. It shows you the rules like a good ref. If you're looking for hands on practice,  then look elsewhere because this only shows you whateve",1
I wanted to help my math but I thought this app should help but no I want a 5th grade app that's free and actually helps,0
"Pretty pointless.  Unless you like putting thumb tacks in a wall.  Then maybe it's for you.  Random touches on the screen redirect your device from game play to advertising.  Not fun, not exciting, not funny... Uninstalled.",0

"Did you know that you can change the bscktound and make the guy wear a tuxedo! amazing right, I love this game my friend, Elis and I think.it is so funny. one time, he even fell over because he was laughing at this app.Get this app : Its really hard to g",1
in my opinion this game is a load of fun you can make shapes attack a person even a stand in for your boss. I like this game because of the gyroscopic controls.,1
it is the perfect time waster pointless and fun over all great app fast download u will want to get this app,1
probably the worst most pointless game ever played. amazon should do something about developers reviewing their own apps. one goes on to say this is hilarious. laugh laugh laugh. B.S.,0
I love this you can do lots of things I like throwing the shapes at him he gets all bloody buy it BUY IT!!!!!!,1
"I highly recommend this app to very angry people. Just pretend the pinman is your worst enemy! lol, this is also a very good time-wasting game:))",1
this game was boring when I got it I thought that there would be levels or something I have never UNinstalled a game so fast if there was a 0 star I would give it to this game,0
you get to pin a man with tacks and you can turn off the blood. and you can get shapes and throw it at him.,1
this game is terrible you poke a little stick figure with a pushpin and that is all that you do it was a.waste of space and I deleted it because it was boring,0
"Until permission to open to the network is explained, I will not download this potential Trojan horse.The same program could easily be run as local only, so it's trying to do something.",0
"all you do is stick a pin in him, as many as you can fit. this gets boring quick. I think I played it once.",0
this is perfect for taking out this guy as in killing him! this is a lot better than punching a sibling,1
I expected this to bad a unique and fun way to waste time simarly to paper toss. but this was a very boring game without any real excitement or fun involved.,0
Use your imagination to have fun. You can pretend like he is a guy who has a new power control or you anything you want.,1
it wont even let me play the freaking game it does force close every time!!! it doesn't solve ur anger issues it make them WORSE!!!,0

"right from the start I didn't like it, their was not much do do. Their was an add covering something in the bottom right corner.  I would not download it.",0
"With or without blood splattering turned on, the app gets old quick.  Perhaps if there were something other than geometric shapes to use, the dummy had texture instead of being a stick-like figure, there were some good sound effects,  and realistic blood",0
"Pinman is a fun fun game, which is great for letting out anger (especially with the blood). You can beat him with objects and pin him to the walls. The best part is, I wont get accused of murderer!!!",1
I think this is great if you tap your guy you switch body's and you can switch map download this it is awesome and your gonna like it,1
stupid there is an add in the corner blocking something on the kindle fire STUPID don't get it if you have a kindle fire,0
My son cannot get enough of this silly app. It's very amusing and catchy. Maybe more background effects would be better.,1
A fun game for when you're bored. Sure to get plenty of laughs from this! Also good for those days when you're really mad hahaha(:,1
Every time I tried to play this game it did not open! Awful game I will never play this game again.,0

"The voice alarm is loud enough on the Kindle Fire which is known to have weak volume overall. It's very handy to have an alarm that can tell you WHY the alarm is going off in the first place. Then, of course, there are the endless possibilities for humor",1
"This app was perfect for easy setting, and my whole day is timed with alarms, right up to 8:00 PM when it goes off for the last time of the day, so I can find it (used to lose it once a day). Then it starts all over at 4:45 am....",1
This app does everything that it is supposed to do.  It works fine on my Kindle Fire.  Remember to put your Kindle to sleep (not off) to save battery life.,1
"This app has a few serious issues. First and most serious, I could not access any of my wireless networks reliably while this app was installed. Second, the app (for whatever reason)  would randomly announce the next alarm time. This can happen while sle",0
you can set lots of different ALARMS/reminders and it will alert you by voicing the text u input into the alarm.  PURE AWESOME. Not always telligible but giving this the full 5 stars because some doufus reviewer gave it 1 star a few days ago.,1
I have a kindle fire. I got this so I was able to wake up in the morning without having an obnoxious sound every morning. I got this so I was able to come up witb a better way. This was a waste of battery. I lost so much on battery and it wouldnt uninsta,0
"There are not enough words about this app.  It's so easy to use, and keeps me on time for everything. Having an app talk to you is fantastic! Waking up to it is so much better than other alarms.  Everyone at work that has seen/heard mine has gotten this ",1

don't get it it is a waste of ur time it has no point to it wat so ever so I'm telling u don't get if is waste ur time,0
"Great brain exercise game. Start out easy and work your way up to expert. Solving the code is different each time you play, so it never gets old. Good for teaching kids about logic.",1
"This is just like the game Mastermind that I used to play, and now I have gotten my children into it as well.  There are 3 different difficulty levels and the games are short, so it is perfect for passing time while waiting in a line.",1
"It isn't too hard and is good for a lite challenge. Since, the response dots don't correlate to the dots on the board, you can never be sure you are right. The game is pretty self explanitory, so even beginners shouldn't have too hard of a time winning.",1
I'm running the free version currently and having no problems with it on my kindle fire. I loved playing this with friends years ago. I used to have it on my Pc until windows 7 came out and my game was no longer compatable. So I'm enjoying this on my kin,1
this is such a fun game and addicting game. I was surprised about how challenging this game was. its actually harder than ya think.,1
"If you can logically think out your next move, this is a great game. If you just want to punch in colors willy nilly, you should skip this game and play something simpler.  Don't give the game a one star rating because you didn't read the brief instructi",1
I am not what you would call a gamer.  I would much rather read or crochet.  One night this little game caught my eye and I thought I would give it a try.  Two hours later I couldn't figure out where the time had gone.  This game is fun and a bit of a ch,1
It reminds meof the game mastermind. It's a fun quick playthat relies on logic to crack a code.,1

"One of my favorite games; love games to stimulate my brain. If you are not a person to sit and analyze things, don't bother. This takes a lot of thinking. If you like to use your brain give this one a go!!",1
I love this app. Going to buy the pro version. Helps me relax in evening. Happy when I suceed in knowing the placements of the colors in short time. Lets me know my intuition is in tune that day. Plus it's just fun! ;).,1
"I am always glued to this game! Whenever I play it, I never lose! Once you play ot for a while, you get the hang of it. My parents can't even figure this game out, even after I explain it and I show them the directions! But it's perfect for my kind of br",1
This game is a great brain game and never gets boring.  I'm having too much fun to go to the MEDIUM and HARD levels but I'm sure I'll get to them eventually.  My husband is not too thrilled with it but I think it's because he gives up too easily.,1
"If you liked Mastermind you'll love this game in which the computer pegs for you. You don't have to be concerned about your opponent pegging incorrectly.  You can guess five colors, like Mastermind, or three or four for an easier game.",1
this game is awesome!!!! it is so much fun!!my brain hurts when I play it....but....it is SO much fun!!!:{),1
"i absolutely love this game... if you are a person that likes mind games, this game is for you. its not too difficult but it keeps you thinking.",1
Nice version of Mastermind game.  I like that it has three levels and the graphics look very pleasing to the eye.  I just wish the clue pegs' colors were a bit more vivid because it's a bit hard to distinguish between the grey and the white sometimes.,1
"i LOVE this game! there is a board game version of this game, which  i have been pleying my whole life, and this is exactly the same thing!  this app is awesome!!!  if you dont have this app,  GET IT!!!!!!!",1

I love this app it is a challanging game of skill and fun. this is so a five star game people!!!!!,1
"As a young boy, I loved the board game &quot;MASTERMIND&quot;.This game is just like it, except it has two great advantages.#1- PLAY VS. CPU:  You don't have to beg your completely uninterested older sister to play the game with you!#2 - VERSATILITY:  Yo",1
I like the ability to change difficulty. I can either challenge myself a lot or a little. My young children even love to try cracking the code!!!!,1

"Excellent game, very challenging to the mind and is entertaining to all age groups from age 10 to age 70.",1
I am amazed this mastermind clone is free. It is incredible and I am convinced.it will help your overall thought process. Don't discount it based on the fact that it is a game or inexpensive.  It is a mind gym.My wife loves this. She has a masters degree,1

"This version is awesome. Keep doing great games. Always like this mind challenging games, instead of killing animals and/or other human beings.",1
"Just like Mastermind.  Simple, but very distracting and--I find--relaxing.  Works great on my kindle fire; no problems that I've noticed.",1
I love this game! It's challenging but not so much that it isn't fun. You can play it over and over without getting bored.,1
This game is enjoyable. For all you smarty pants who like puzzle games this one may be for you. Good exercise for the brain and an easy way to pass the time. Glad there are different levels the game works for many age groups.,1
"Like all of Optime Software's games, this is a great puzzle. Solve the code to win the game. Sounds easy, right? Oh, what little you know ;)A big bonus is the &#34;color blind&#34; feature, for those of us who have trouble with subtle shades.",1
This is the game I played with my children.  My 4 year old granddaughter loves to play this on my kindle.,1
"As a kid, we played Mastermind in our house for hours and hours. I loved the deducing of it all and when it all came together quickly, voila! I love that I can play this as a solitaire game, select the level (depends on the number of pegs you want to gue",1

This is a very entertaining game. Not too difficult but still makes you think a bit. There are different levels for different skill levels.,1
Much fun without a lot of fuss. The ads are less intrusive than I feared too. Good one that works well on the Fire.,1
"It is confusing. I mean, I followed the instructions and all, but it was still confusing. You couldn't guess the code at all!!",0
It's right from the old days of Mastermind. I can understand why some folks are giving this a bad review. I guess they just aren't up for the mental challenge.,1
"I used to have this game in plastic form (Mastermind) and would play it with my son. It's not hard, but makes you think. Great for a free app.",1
"This game is a brain teaser. I love it, love love it. This is a great game. i cannot stop playing it. I would encourage anyone to buy and play this game, especially if you want to keep your brain stimulated. GREAT GAME.",1

I know someone says this is imposssble but it'd not. its a fun mind game. and it is amazing on the kindle fire.,1
I got my game for free and thought it would be boring.  I was surprised on how I got caught up into solving the code. Its good for passing the time. I even got my husband hooked on the game :),1
Never thought I'd get hooked on this game.  Helps you think critically hence I won't consider it as a total waste of time.  On the contrary it may be a good brain exerciser.,1
"I played Mastermind with my sisters when I was younger and I never could figure it out.  Now as an adult, I can sometimes get the 3 colors right. Ha, ha!  Still working on my patience and focus to figure out the solution. Definitely worth having for the ",1
I love this game and it is fun to play but it takes a lot of skill and it is like a mind twisted. Do you want to get you brain ready to think? Take a turn at playing the game.Ttyl peace out detectives code crackers!!!!! :),1
i love this app. I always played this game on my Pc and now I can play it all the time. strongly recommend.,1

good game... keeps your brain sharp and fun too! only use medium level because that is what the original game has.,1
This game is very fun. I tried to teach my teacher to play but then she wouldn't give it back.,1
"great for flexing your brain. the easy level is still a challenge for me, but this is a great opportunity to exercise logic skills.",1
This is such an addictive game!  It really makes me have to process my moves. My memory is getting bad and my Doc told me that this kind of activity will help me to retain it. I love it!,1
don't buy it. its a waste of time and its LITERALLY impossible to crack the code. Even on EASY! I would rate this a zero if I could.,0
love playing this game. good for problem solving and thinking. Its nice for everyone. it can be tricky but that's the pint right?,1
This is how I remember playing the game years ago.  The game looks great on the Kindle fire.  I would have picked another color than black to indicate that the color chosen was correct and in the proper spot.,1
It works great on my kindle and is VERY addictive! I suggest you to get it I love it a lot!,1
a fun and quick test of your powers of deduction. it encourages critical thinking. and can be fun for the entire family.,1

My ten year old loves this app as much as I do. It is so much fun. Easy to use too. I have played for hours.,1
"Thought this would be a challenging game, but the rules left me just guessing.  It wasn't fun, just frustrating.  If someone can tell me how to play, I'll try again, otherwise...",0
"Solve the sequence in which the beads of color appear. Harder levels give you less opportunity to waste guesses. It's a game of deduction, and hones your ability to read between the lines.",1
This game is both mind boggling and fun. I love playing this type of game.Its great! Its like the real board game mastermind which I love playing so this is even better!,1
"I've always loved Mastermind and was looking for an app to imitate the game. This was it. Even better, it has levels of difficulty. Easy to use, and no problems with it freezing or not working properly. Worthwhile download.",1

"Okay, once caveat - it is easy to use for a novice if you know a little bit about what you are doing!  If you are saying &#34;what's an audio tag?&#34;, then this may not be the program for you, and perhaps a little reading on audio tagging is in order! ",1
Let me update my songs information right in the app. There was no issue doing it and it saved a lot of time instead of going to my computer and fixing it from there.,1

And this is my favorite sudoku app.  It is the easiest to mark your notes and automaticly corrects the notes when you place your pernament number in position and it highlights the number when you have placed all nine numbers in to the grid.,1
I paid fir My Horoscope Pro but the app says I have to pay MORE for &quot;Pro&quot; ad-free.  I want my money back!!!!,0
This is definitely the best horoscope app it's so great it tells my day almost perfectly and it gives the best advice,1
I have found Horoscope Pro to be a great way to get my daily forecast and also share with others.,1
"I find this app to be fun, amusing, and entertaining. Its even spot on sometimes. I like looking up my friends' horoscopes to see what kind of a day they were supposed to have. Easy to use, no problems.",1
I know real emotional feelings towards is out it's amazing as matter fact I would rate it a5 point 5 if it went over 5 stars its so accurate with my motional State day today it blows my mind still everytime I look at it I once had an epic astrology book ,1
"Well I was looking for an app to guive me an outlook for the day, this is not it. I do not understand it organization or it degins. I does not seem to work all that great for day to day...would ot recommend as it is. I wanted to like it.",0
"THIS APP IS ONE OF THE BEST HOROSCOPE APPS I HAVE USED, PROBABLY ACTUALLY THE BEST I HAVE USED. RIGHT ON WITH THE EMOTIONS AND MORE. THANKS.",1
This app is very insightful. It is accurate and helps me know what to expect from my day and my emotions. I definitely recommend this app it's worth your money.,1
I like this application. I got it because it seemed simple and easy to use. It has one thought per day which usually appear to be uplifting or motivational.  Because I don't always remember to check daily I really enjoy the feature that allows me to revi,1
I like that I'm able to see what kind of day I am going to have. I think that it can happen or not I tried not to take to heart.,1
"This is one of the best daily horoscope apps. I highly recommend it.Easy to use, and lots of fun.",1
"I like being able to push a button and read what the stars have aligned for me. I say ME but there are many people with the same sign, so each and everyone of us has to figure out what to do with the information we are given.",1
GREAT APP FOR HOROSCOPE READERS. A LOT OF THEM HAPPEN TO BE TRUE. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. THANK YOU.,1
"Got this app because I'm someone who likes to read my horoscope daily(which really means whatever day I remember to check the app). But, this app is great for that since it lets you see the four most recent days. The graphics are very pretty and it's eas",1
the app is easy to use and the interface very cute. I really like seeing what my horoscope says for the day. The only thing I might suggest is a little daily notification  saying new horoscope for the day available because I tend to forget to check it.,1
"I enjoy this app for entertainment purposes. Lot of fun but sometimes right on the mark. I don't read it until later in the day, to see how close it gets. Lot of surprises that way since I don't use app to govern my life.",1
My horoscope pro has hit who I am and what I need to do for the day very much worth the dollar,1
I really like this app because so few sites divide each sign into the correct stage of the sun. Not everyone realizes that particular &quot;subsign&quot;. For example I am a late Pisces &amp; I am quite different from an early Pisces.,1
",This is excellent if you want to know the weather in your area, .especially when bad weather approaches. I really like it!!",1
"I like the fact each horoscope sign is divided into 4 decanates providing a little less generaization than most horoscopes.  At this point, I sm still validating accuracy.",1
I loved this app so much I decided to buy the app to send the message that there are great apps out there.Not suggesting that you purchase the app. Keep up the good work ID Mobile SA.Thanks!,1
I like it its just that it uses the same fourtans every couple other times. I gave it a 5 star reveiw I like it and I hope you do to!,1

This is a great little app for checking daily horoscope.  I have some about my zodiac sign.  Turns out I was destined to be the person I am today. LOL!,1
I think this is a very good app! but it doesn't do very much. I think it needs to add more options!!!!!!!!,1
"This horoscope app will be my all time favorite! This reveals what happens everyday and how not only your zodiac sign should react, but it breaks down the three decanates in a precise organized form. Decan's provided the readings of the RULER, SUB-RULER,",1

I like being able to check my horoscope with more details than what I am used to because I never believed I fit into my sign.,1

Unfortunately this would not open in my android. I wish it would have; it could  have been an entertaining app.,0
January 6 is in the second part of Capricorn ......read instructions before u rate something bad for your own short coming. Very useful and entertaining tool Thanks,1

"I tried playing this for about 10 minutes, and then just said screw it i'm bored.  I might just not be a hardcore enough RPG'er",0
My rating is based off of the time I've spent playing this game.  Fun and addicting if you love sci0fi stuff you will enjoy this text based game.  Be warned you will get sick of this game after a while.,1
"This game is loads of fun.  You can play differently depending on your style, military, spy, trader, etc. Expect to lose some sleep.",1
Probably the best android game i have played. The dev's constantly update the game. Download the free game before paying the price for the paid game and make sure it's for you.,1
"Unable to use on old Droid X2 and forced closing a constant issue. It was suggested to go with the paid version and it performed as well as the free version. NOT AT ALL. Perhaps more hardware related, but they need to work hand in hand,",0
nothing to it has many problems you dont see anything and is hard to follow pretty much sums it up,0
I really enjoy this game. the detail into some of the thought is great. graphics are good. some things could be better like knowing which planets are what and under what faction but overall a great game. lots of options and plenty of stuff to do.  thanks,1
"i have the full premuim version of star traders. this game is absolutely fantastic if getting rich amid galactic empires is your thing. note this game has. very steep learning curve and is not easy, with harder modes even having permanent death.",1
I play the premium version. It works great on Kindle Fire HD and I have never had any problems. Game is fully functional when there is no wifi access. The developers frequently update with more content.,1
This takes me back to the days of text based rpgs. Way too much fun. I can waste hours at a time playing.,1
I love this app and planning on getting elite this is a epic app I recconmond it to all people,1
"This game is awesome. I cannot say enough good things about it. If you liked Trade Wars 2002, Outpost Trader or Planets: The Exploration of Space back in the BBS days, you will feel right at home with Star Traders RPG.",1
"Brings me back to my teens, playing TradeWars on the local WWIV BBSes.  It isn't much of a casual game, but I don't mind at all.  Most of the apps I find are short attention-span style games.  This one is one of those that you really get to spend some ti",1
"This game is better than I thought it would be, I've spent hours playing it. I'm going to get the elite version so I can get more upgrades and ships and go to more planets. This game plays smooth and fast on my Kindle Fire. I absolutely love this game.",1
Brings back fond memories of &quot;Privateer&quot;.  Not an easy game. A real game that rewards deep and continuous play.  The Trese brothers know how to do it right.  All their games are great and the elite versions are worth more than their price.  Exc,1
"Kind of reminds of that old game that's not available for (DOS) PC's anymore. Mine, sell, trade, improve. Great sim!",1

"this app does exactly what it says it does, gives you a quick reference card for hex codes of html colors. there's nothing on here to go wrong. its just a page with color boxes an hex codes. I'm very pleased with it",1
"It's listed as a quick reference card, and that's just what it is - quick reference. Displays swatches of color with the hex codes underneath them, with a zoom feature should you need it. I can usually figure out RGBs, it's the hex codes I have trouble w",1
I teach photography and design and this is a simple and precise color guide. It is well done and attractive.,1

this is the best app EVER! I was able to do my taxes in 10 minutes. Super convenient. Will DEFINITELY use this app again next year!!!,1
"easy to use, fast did not take any time at all to get my taxes done and got results quick",1
"THOUGHT this might really help at tax time, but after reading the other reviews about going half way through inputting your info and then being instructed to pay for more help I deleted it.  Can't even tell you how much I hate those time wasters and",0
Almost too good to be true! Only complaint was that my rebate was larger!! :) Would recommend &amp; will probably use in future.,1
"i don't like. having to pay to file taxes, but this tool does what is says and is easy to use.",1
"I input a lot of info then it wouldnt work, this is who i have been using in the past",0
I am very disappointed they are misleading and know the psychology behind claiments and use it as an advertising bonanaza. Ripoffs,0
"This app made doing my taxes so easy this year. I had used another tax program for years, and been very happy with it. When I went through that program this year the bottom line was I owed IRS over $450. I downloaded TurbTax here for free on March 31st. ",1
"Wow, at first I was skeptic about this so called SnapTax take a photo of my tax return and poof it appears on the screen. Oh but was I wrong it took 2 seconds and it had all my info and was ready to file. Unbelievably user friendly interface for the novi",1
You have to go online and pay $79 to finish your taxes. This is a complete lie and is dishonest at best.,0
Did my taxes on this and efiled.  Loved it!  Easy to use and reliable.  I am very happy with Snaptax and with Turbotax.,1
I was surprised by how easy it was. It only took 20 minutes and most of that was looking up information I forgot to print out first.,1

I had no problems. Pretty straightforward and easy to use. I filed today before 9:50 pm PST. Awesome deal for 14.99.,1
beautifully executed bait and switch. after you enter a ton of info it claims your return is too complicated for the android app and offers to transfer said info to the paid app. of course you go for it because you don't want to start all over. what is s,0
"I cannot say how baf it is when a game does not have an actual quit, but only allows you to  press the home button to end it. Bad. Bad. Bad. Who knows what it does when you leave that way.  Also, this game is slow between &rdquo; shots&rdquo;.",0
"I can't believe this game doesn't have more 5 star reviews. its a lot of fun, I like it and my kids do too. Definitely worth playing.",1
"I downloaded it, tried it and deleted it. I'd prefer a mini-golf or actual golf game. This is just silly.",0
"lol, more fun than I thought this would be.  I'll be trying to get a real life game of this going around the office on Monday. Well done devs.",1
"This is both hilarious and fun! I can see it may get old quickly, but I am enjoying it now.",1
where is the exit button?  the app doesn't exit. need to force stop. otherwise its an ok game for free.,0
I adore this game. My son and I laugh out loud trying different angles to improve our scores. Don't  miss this one.,1
"Kindle Fire review - Read the reviews and listen to the ones who have actually played the game.  Good graphics, great concept.  Controls work fine.  Certainly not an easy game, but then where would be the fun in that?  Normally I would give this four sta",1

Just another boring golf game. Nothing stabs out and nothing special enough to warrant purchasing. Piss on this one and don't pay it any mind,0
This game is seriously fun. It's a challenging and interesting take on golf. Sure the boss is annoying but that's what obstacles are supposed to be.  I could do without the commentator's bad accent though! Gotta turn him off.,1
